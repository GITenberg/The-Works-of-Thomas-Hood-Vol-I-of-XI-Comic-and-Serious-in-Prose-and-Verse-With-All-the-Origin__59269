<p>I<span class="smaller">T</span> is now many years ago, nay, more than half a century, since Thomas
Hood first began to wield the pen which was to do such good service
to literature. The first scrap of his boyish versifying that can now
be traced, consists of a sort of rhyming description of Dundee, after
the manner of Anstey’s Bath Guide, and this is dated 1815.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That he
was prematurely cut off by disease, accelerated by overwork while in
the very prime of his mental powers, is now well known. The Works he
left behind have gradually but steadily risen in popular esteem and
circulation ever since his death,&mdash;in other countries besides his own,
and on both sides of the Atlantic,&mdash;so that there are now few writers
of this century better appreciated and becoming more widely known than
Thomas Hood.</p>

<p>I believe that one part at least of the secret of this great and
increasing value for his writings, lies in the fact, that like our
great Shakespeare, and even another deep writer and thinker of our own
time,&mdash;Thackeray,&mdash;he wrote such pure, vigorous, intelligible English.
He speaks in his works to the great mass of the people in a tongue they
can understand and thoroughly feel. However far his abundant fancy and
versatile humour may lead him from the track, there is no obscurity
to puzzle as well as dazzle. And this almost severe plainness of
expression serves him well in such poems, for instance, as the “Song
of the Shirt,” where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> the repetition of the homeliest phrases make the
intensity of the suffering stand out in a more appalling reality.</p>

<p>It is with a view to meeting the wants of all classes of readers and
spreading the knowledge of Thomas Hood’s Works still farther, that the
present edition has been planned, in a cheap form that will place it
within everybody’s reach. The publishers have already issued editions
of all the Works, either complete, or in separate volumes, to suit
every taste.</p>

<p>The present edition embraces the complete Works with the original
illustrations, and also includes some hitherto unpublished dramatic
fragments. It will be issued in a convenient periodical form, to be
obtained at the option of the purchaser either in Monthly Parts, or
Quarterly Volumes. The last generation will no doubt welcome in the old
familiar form the Author’s quaint wood-cut illustrations, as well as
the humorous illustrations of George Cruickshank to the “Epping Hunt,”
with those by Harvey to “Eugene Aram;” and the present generation are
still too recently mourning the loss of John Leech’s graceful pencil,
to pass carelessly by his admirable drawings in the “Whimsicalities.”
The completeness and low price of this edition will, it is hoped, place
it in the hands of most readers.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smaller">HE</span> present arrangement of my Father’s works for a complete and uniform
edition has not been determined on without due deliberation. It
appeared to me that for the requirements of those&mdash;who do not care to
trace his career as a writer from his first connection with Literature,
and to note the gradual development of a genius which, at the time of
his death, had not arrived at its fulness&mdash;enough is to be found in
the edition of the “Serious Poems;” of those of “Wit and Humour;” of
the “Whims and Oddities;” and of two volumes of “Hood’s Own,” already
published by Messrs. Moxon.</p>

<p>I have therefore considered it best, when called upon to prepare a
complete and uniform series of his writings, to throw the materials
collected into a form which shall be of interest to more than the
general reader. By republishing his works in the order in which they
were written, as far as my most diligent search and most earnest
endeavours can establish it, I believe I shall meet the wishes of
many of my Father’s admirers and readers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> who have contracted, from
the perusal of his works, an almost friendlike interest, that will be
gratified by tracing step by step the bent of his mind, the progress of
his intellect, and the maturing of his powers.</p>

<p>It may be urged that I have reprinted fugitive articles that might well
have been omitted without detriment to the Series. To this I might
answer by pleading that it is only natural that I should place greater
store by what my Father has written, than one not so nearly related to
him would do.</p>

<p>But believing, as I do, that the less laboured writings of an author
are among the surest indices of his thought and the best tests of his
genius, I have omitted nothing that I thought would assist the real
student of Literature, and its ministers&mdash;literary men&mdash;to a true
estimate of my Father&mdash;whether as an author or a man; holding always
in recollection that quaint wise saying of Selden’s, anent similar
trifles&mdash;“Take a straw, and throw it up into the air, you may see by
that which way the wind is; which you shall not do by casting up a
stone.”</p>

<p>Wherever I have been able to find anything of interest bearing upon the
works, I have added it as briefly as possible in my notes&mdash;giving any
alterations of the text, any fragments connected with or relating to
portions of it and such explanations of allusions contained in it, as
seemed advisable.</p>

<p>As far as lies in my power, I have left out nothing that may interest
the thoughtful and studious, while I have endeavoured not to weary the
cursory reader with long annotations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>I have no wish, and indeed no need to deprecate criticism&mdash;for whenever
it has been my task to prepare anything connected with my Father for
publication, I have always met with a reception that proved to me
how fully my critics have understood the difficulties which I have
encountered. The kindly spirit in which the “Memorials” of my Father
were received, encourages me to hope that my sincere desire to perform
what I really feel as a sacred duty and responsibility, will be looked
on with the same indulgence; for it should be remembered that many, nay
most of those contemporaries of my Father, who could have pointed out
where his scattered writings were to be found, are dead.</p>

<p>To those intimate acquaintances of his who survive, and who have
assisted me most materially in my arduous yet most grateful
undertaking, as well as to numerous friends,&mdash;many unknown to me in the
flesh,&mdash;who have so readily answered my appeals, through the public
press, for information and assistance, I tender my most heartfelt
thanks,</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">OURTEOUS</span> R<span class="smaller">EADER</span>!</p>

<p><span class="mleft3">Presuming</span> that you have known something of the Comic Annual from its
Child-Hood, when it was first put into half binding and began to run
alone, I make bold to consider you as an old friend of the family, and
shall accordingly treat you with all the freedom and confidence that
pertain to such ripe connexions.</p>

<p>How many years is it, think you, “since we were first acquent?”</p>

<p>“By the deep <i>nine</i>!” sings out the old bald <i>Count Fathom</i> with the
lead-line: no great lapse in the world’s chronology, but a space of
infinite importance in individual history. For instance, it has wrought
a serious change on the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> if not on the mind, of your very humble
servant;&mdash;it is not, however, to bespeak your sympathy, or to indulge
in what Lord Byron calls “the gloomy vanity of drawing from self,”
that I allude to my personal experience. The Scot and lot character of
the dispensation, forbids me to think that the world in general can
be particularly interested in the state of my Household Sufferage, or
that the public ear will be as open to my Maladies as to my Melodies.
The simple truth is, that, being a wiser but not sadder man, I propose
to admit you to my Private View of a system of Practical Cheerful
Philosophy, thanks to which, perchance, the cranium of your Humorist
is still secure from such a lecture as was delivered over the skull of
Poor Yorick.</p>

<p>In the absence of a certain thin “blue-and-yellow” visage, and
attenuated figure,&mdash;whose effigies may one day be affixed to the
present work,&mdash;you will not be prepared to learn that some of
the merriest effusions in the forthcoming numbers have been the
relaxations of a gentleman literally enjoying bad health&mdash;the carnival,
so to speak, of a personified Jour Maigre. The very fingers so
aristocratically slender, that now hold the pen, hint plainly of the
“<i>ills</i> that <i>flesh</i> is heir to:”&mdash;my coats have become great coats, my
pantaloons are turned into trousers, and, by a worse bargain then Peter
Schlemihl’s, I seem to have retained my shadow and sold my substance.
In short, as happens to prematurely old port wine, I am of a bad colour
with very little body. But what then? That emaciated hand still lends
a hand to embody in words and sketches the creations or recreations
of a Merry Fancy: those gaunt sides yet shake heartily as ever at the
Grotesques and Arabesques and droll Picturesques that my Good Genius
(a Pantagruelian Familiar) charitably conjures up to divert me from
more sombre realities. It was the whim of a late pleasant Comedian, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
suppose a set of spiteful imps sitting up aloft, to aggravate all his
petty mundane annoyances; whereas I prefer to believe in the ministry
of kindlier Elves, that “nod to me and do me courtesies.” Instead of
scaring away these motes in the sunbeam, I earnestly invoke them, and
bid them welcome; for the tricksy spirits make friends with the animal
spirits, and do not I, like a father romping with his own urchins,&mdash;do
not I forget half my cares whilst partaking in their airy gambols? Such
sports are as wholesome for the mind as the other frolics for the body.
For on our own treatment of that excellent Friend or terrible Enemy the
Imagination, it depends whether we are to be scared and haunted by a
Scratching Fanny, or tended by an affectionate Invisible Girl&mdash;like an
unknown love, blessing us with “favours secret, sweet, and precious,”
and fondly stealing us from this worky-day world to a sunny sphere of
her own.</p>

<p>This is a novel version, Reader, of “Paradise and the Pen,” but it is
as true as it is new. How else could I have converted a serious illness
into a comic wellness&mdash;by what other agency could I have transported
myself, as a Cockney would say, from <i>Dull</i>age to <i>Grin</i>age? It was
far from a practical joke to be laid up in ordinary in a foreign land,
under the care of Physicians quite as much abroad as myself with the
case; indeed the shades of the gloaming were stealing over my prospect;
but I resolved, that, like the sun, so long as my day lasted, I
would look on the bright side of everything. The raven croaked, but
I persuaded myself that it was the nightingale: there was the smell
of the mould, but I remembered that it nourished the violets. However
my body might cry craven, my mind luckily had no mind to give in. So,
instead of mounting on the black long-tailed coach horse, she vaulted
on her old Hobby that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> had capered in the Morris-Dance, and began to
exhort from its back. To be sure, said she, matters look darkly enough;
but the more need for the lights. Allons! Courage! Things may take a
turn, as the pig said on the spit. Never throw down your cards, but
play out the game. The more certain to lose, the wiser to get all the
play you can for your money. Come&mdash;give us a song! chirp away like that
best of cricket-players, the cricket himself. Be bowled out or caught
out, but never throw down the bat. As to Health, it’s the weather of
the body&mdash;it hails, it rains, it blows, it snows, at present, but it
may clear up by-and-by. You cannot eat, you say, and you must not
drink; but laugh and make believe, like the Barber’s wise brother at
the Barmecide’s feast. Then, as to thinness, not to flatter, you look
like a lath that has had a split with the carpenter and a fall out with
the plaster; but so much the better! remember how the smugglers trim
the sails of the lugger to escape the notice of the cutter. Turn your
edge to the old enemy, and mayhap he won’t see you! Come&mdash;be alive! You
have no more right to slight your life than to neglect your wife&mdash;they
are the two better halves that make a man of you! Is not life your
means of living? so stick to thy business and thy business will stick
to thee. Of course, continued my mind, I am quite disinterested in this
advice&mdash;for I am aware of my own immortality but for that very reason,
take care of the mortal body, poor body, and give it as long a day as
you can!</p>

<p>Now, my mind seeming to treat the matter very pleasantly as well as
profitably, I followed her counsel, and instead of calling out for
relief according to the fable, I kept along on my journey, with my
bundle of sticks,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> my arms and legs. Between ourselves, it would
have been “extremely inconvenient,” as I once heard the opium-eater
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>clare, to pay the debt of nature at that particular juncture; nor
do I quite know, to be candid, when it would altogether suit me to
settle it, so, like other parties in narrow circumstances, I laughed,
and gossiped, and played the agreeable with all my might; and as
such pleasant behaviour sometimes obtains a respite from a human
creditor, who knows but that it may prove successful with the Universal
Mortgagee? At all events, here I am, humming “Jack’s Alive!” and my
own dear skilful native physician gives me hopes of a longer lease
than appeared from the foreign reading of the covenants. He declares
indeed, that, anatomically, my heart is lower hung than usual&mdash;but what
of that? <i>The more need to keep it up!</i> So huzza! my boys! Comas and
Momus for ever! No Heraclitus! Nine times nine for Democritus! And here
goes my last bottle of Elixir at the heads of the Blue Devils&mdash;be they
Prussian blue or indigo, powder-blue or ultramarine!</p>

<p>Gentle reader, how do you like this Laughing Philosophy? The joyous
cheers you have just heard, come from a crazy vessel that has clawed,
by miracle, off a lee-shore, and I, the skipper, am sitting down to
my grog, and recounting to you the tale of the past danger, with the
manœuvres that were used to escape the perilous Point. Or rather,
consider me as the Director of a Life Assurance, pointing out to you a
most beneficial policy, whereby you may eke out your natural term. And,
firstly, take precious care of your precious health,&mdash;but how, as the
housewives say, to make it keep? Why, then, don’t care and smoke-dry
it&mdash;or pickle it in everlasting acids&mdash;like the Germans. Don’t bury it
in a potato-pit, like the Irish. Don’t preserve it in spirits, like
the Barbadians. Don’t salt it down, like the Newfoundlanders. Don’t
pack it in ice, like Captain Back. Don’t parboil it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> in Hot Baths.
Don’t bottle it, like gooseberries. Don’t pot it&mdash;and don’t hang it. A
rope is a bad Cordon Sanitaire. Above all, don’t despond about it. Let
not anxiety “have thee on the hyp.” Consider your health as your best
friend, and think as well of it, in spite of all its foibles, as you
can. For instance, never dream, though you may have a “clever hack,” of
galloping consumption, or indulge in the Meltonian belief, that you are
going the pace. Never fancy every time you cough, that you are going
to coughy-pot. Hold up, as the shooter says, over the heaviest ground.
Despondency in a nice case is the over-weight that may make you kick
the beam and the bucket both at once. In short, as with other cases,
never meet trouble half-way, but let him have the whole walk for his
pains; though it should be a Scotch mile and a bittock. I have even
known him to give up his visit in sight of the house. Besides, the best
fence against care is a ha! ha!&mdash;wherefore take care to have one all
round you wherever you can. Let your “lungs crow like Chanticleer,”
and as like a G<span class="smaller">AME</span> cock as possible. It expands the chest,
enlarges the heart, quickens the circulation, and “like a trumpet makes
the spirit dance.”</p>

<p>A fico then for the Chesterfieldian canon, that laughter is an
ungenteel emotion. Smiles are tolerated by the very pinks of
politeness; and a laugh is but the full-blown flower of which a smile
is the bud. It is a sort of vocal music&mdash;a glee in which everybody can
take a part:&mdash;and “he who bath not laughter in his soul, let no such
man be trusted.” Indeed, there are two classes of Querists particularly
to be shunned; thus when you hear a Cui Bono? be sure to leave the
room; but if it be Quid Rides? make a point to quit the house, and
forget to take its number. None but your dull dogs would give tongue in
such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> a style,&mdash;for, as Nimrod says in his “Hunt after Happiness,” “A
single <i>burst</i> with Mirth is worth a whole season of <i>full cries</i> with
Melancholy.”</p>

<p>Such, dear reader, is the cheerful Philosophy which I practise as well
as preach. It teaches to “make a sunshine in a shady place,” to render
the mind independent of external foul weather, by compelling it, as
old Absolute says, to get a sun and moon of its own. As the system has
worked so well in my own case, it is a duty to recommend it to others;
and like certain practitioners, who not only prescribe but dispense
their own medicines, I have prepared a regular course of light reading,
whereof I now present the first packet, in the humble hope that your
dull hours may be amused, and your cares diverted, by the laughing
lucubrations which have enlivened Hood’s Own.</p>

<p>H<span class="smaller">OW</span> the following correspondence came into my hands must remain
a Waverley mystery. The Pugsley Papers were neither rescued from
a garret, like the Evelyn,&mdash;collected from cartridges, like the
Culloden,&mdash;nor saved, like the Garrick, from being shredded into a
snow storm at a Winter Theatre. They were not snatched from a tailor’s
shears, like the original parchment of Magna Charta. They were neither
the Legacy of a Dominie, nor the communications of My Landlord,&mdash;a
consignment, like the Clinker Letters, from some Rev. Jonathan
Dustwich,&mdash;nor the waifs and strays of a Twopenny Post Bag. They were
not unrolled from ancient papyri. They were none of those that “line
trunks, clothe spices,” or paper the walls of old attics. They were
neither given to me nor sold to me,&mdash;nor stolen,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>nor borrowed and
surreptitiously copied,&mdash;nor left in a hackney coach, like Sheridan’s
play,&mdash;nor misdelivered by a carrier pigeon,&mdash;nor dreamt of, like
Coleridge’s Kubla Khan,&mdash;nor turned up in the Tower, like Milton’s
Foundling MS.,&mdash;nor dug up,&mdash;nor trumped up, like the eastern tales of
Horam harum Horam, the son of Asmar,&mdash;nor, brought over by Rammohun
Roy,&mdash;nor translated by Doctor Bowring from the Scandinavian, Batavian,
Pomeranian, Spanish, or Danish, or Russian, or Prussian, or any other
language dead or living. They were not picked from the Dead Letter
Office, nor purloined from the British Museum. In short, I cannot, dare
not, will not, hint even at the mode of their acquisition: the reader
must be content to know, that, in point of authenticity, the Pugsley
Papers are the extreme reverse of Lady L.’s celebrated Autographs,
which were all written by the proprietor.</p>

<p>Huzza!&mdash;Here I am in Lincolnshire! It’s good-bye to Wellingtons and
Cossacks, Ladies’ double channels, Gentlemen’s stout calf, and ditto
ditto. They’ve all been sold off under prime cost, and the old Shoe
Mart is disposed of, goodwill and fixtures for ever and ever. Father
has been made a rich Squire of by will, and we’ve got a house and
fields, and trees of our own. Such a garden, Bob!&mdash;It beats White
Conduit.</p>

<p>Now, Bob, I’ll tell you what I want. I want you to come down here for
the holidays. Don’t be afraid. Ask your Sister to ask your Mother to
ask your Father to let you come. It’s only ninety mile. If you’re out
of pocket money, you can walk, and beg a lift now and then, or swing
by the dickies. Put on cordroys, and don’t care for cut behind. The
two prentices, George and Will, are here to be made farmers of, and
brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> Nick is took home from school to help in agriculture. We like
farming very much, it’s capital fun. Us four have got a gun, and go
out shooting: it’s a famous good un, and sure to go off if you don’t
full cock it. Tiger is to be our shooting dog, as soon as he has left
off killing the sheep. He’s a real savage, and worries cats beautiful.
Before Father comes down, we mean to bait our bull with him.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of New Rivers about, and we’re going a fishing as soon
as we have mended our top joint. We’ve killed one of our sheep on the
sly to get gentles. We’ve a pony, too, to ride upon when we can catch
him, but he’s loose in the paddock, and has neither mane nor tail to
signify to lay hold of. Isn’t it prime, Bob? You must come. If your
Mother won’t give your Father leave to allow you,&mdash;run away. Remember,
you turn up Goswell Street to go to Lincolnshire, and ask for Middlefen
Hall. There’s a pond full of frogs, but we won’t pelt them till you
come, but let it be before Sunday, as there’s our own orchard to rob,
and the fruit’s to be gathered on Monday.</p>

<p>If you like sucking raw eggs, we know where the hens lay, and mother
don’t; and I’m bound there’s lots of birds’ nests. Do come, Bob,
and I’ll show you the wasps’ nest, and everything that can make you
comfortable. I dare say you could borrow your father’s volunteer
musket of him without his knowing of it; but be sure anyhow to bring
the ramrod, as we have mislaid ours by firing it off. Don’t forget
some bird-lime, Bob&mdash;and some fish-hooks&mdash;and some different sorts
of shot&mdash;and some gut and some gunpowder and a gentle box, and some
flints,&mdash;some May flies, and a powder horn,&mdash;and a landing net and
a dog-whistle&mdash;and some porcupine quills, and a bullet mould&mdash;and a
trolling-winch, and a shot-belt and a tin can. You pay for ’em, Bob,
and I’ll owe it you.</p>

<p>Deeply solicitous to gratify sensibility, by sympathising with our
fortuitous elevation, I seize the epistolary implements to inform
you, that, by the testamentary disposition of a remote branch of
consanguinity, our tutelary residence is removed from the metropolitan
horizon to a pastoral district and its congenial pursuits. In futurity
I shall be more pertinaciously superstitious in the astrological
revelations of human destiny. You remember the mysterious gipsy at
Hornsey Wood?&mdash;Well, the eventful fortune she obscurely intimated,
though couched in vague terms, has come to pass in minutest
particulars; for I perceive perspicuously, that it predicted that
papa should sell off his boot and shoe business at 133, Barbican, to
Clack and Son, of 144, Hatton Garden, and that we should retire, in a
station of affluence, to Middlefen Hall, in Lincolnshire, by bequest of
our great-great maternal uncle, Pollexfen Goldsworthy Wrigglesworth,
Esq., who deceased suddenly of apoplexy at Wisbeach Market, in the
ninety-third year of his venerable and lamented age.</p>

<p>At the risk of tedium, I will attempt a cursory delineation of our
rural paradise, altho’ I feel it would be morally arduous, to give any
idea of the romantic scenery of the Lincolnshire Fens. Conceive, as far
as the visual organ expands, an immense sequestered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> level, abundantly
irrigated with minute rivulets, and studded with tufted oaks, whilst
more than a hundred windmills diversify the prospect and give a
revolving animation to the scene. As for our own gardens and grounds,
they are a perfect Vauxhall&mdash;excepting, of course, the rotunda, the
orchestra, the company, the variegated lamps, the fire-works, and those
very lofty trees. But I trust my dear Jemima will supersede topography
by ocular inspection; and in the interim I send for acceptance a
graphical view of the locality, shaded in Indian ink, which will
suffice to convey an idea of the terrestrial verdure and celestial
azure we enjoy, in lieu of the sable exhalations and architectural
nigritude of the metropolis.</p>

<p>You who know my pastoral aspirings, and have been the indulgent
confidant of my votive tributes to the Muses, will conceive the refined
nature of my enjoyment when I mention the intellectual repast of this
morning. I never could enjoy Bloomfield in Barbican,&mdash;but to-day he
read beautifully under our pear-tree. I look forward to the felicity of
reading Thomson’s Summer with you on the green seat, and if engagements
at Christmas permit your participation in the bard, there is a bower of
evergreens that will be delightful for the perusal of his Winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>I enclose, by request, an epistolary effusion from sister Dorothy,
which I know will provoke your risible powers, by the domesticity of
its details. You know she was always in the homely characteristics a
perfect Cinderella, though I doubt whether even supernatural agency
could adapt her foot to a diminutive vitrified slipper, or her hand
for a prince of regal primogeniture. But I am summoned to receive,
with family members, the felicitations of Lincolnshire aristocracy;
though whatever necessary distinctions may prospectively occur between
respective grades in life, they will only superficially affect the
sentiments of eternal friendship between my dear Jemima and her
affectionate friend,</p>

<p>Providence having been pleased to remove my domestic duties from
Barbican to Lincolnshire, I trust I shall have strength of constitution
to fulfil them as becomes my new allotted line of life. As we are
not sent into this world to be idle, and Anastasia has declined
housewifery, I have undertaken the Dairy, and the Brewery, and the
Baking, and the Poultry, the Pigs and the Pastry,&mdash;and though I feel
fatigued at first, use reconciles to labours and trials, more severe
than I at present enjoy. Altho’ things may not turn out to wish at
present, yet all well-directed efforts are sure to meet reward in the
end, and altho’ I have chumped and churned two days running, and it’s
nothing yet but curds and whey, I should be wrong to despair of eating
butter of my own making before I die. Considering the adulteration
committed by every article in London, I was never happier in any
prospect, than of drinking my own milk, fattening my own calves, and
laying my own eggs. We cackle so much I am sure we new-lay somewhere,
tho’ I cannot find out our nests; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> am looking every day to have
chickens, as one pepper-and-salt-coloured hen has been setting these
two months. When a poor ignorant bird sets me such an example of
patience, how can I repine at the hardest domestic drudgery! Mother
and I have worked like horses to be sure, ever since we came to the
estate; but if we die in it, we know it’s for the good of the family,
and to agreeably surprise my Father, who is still in town winding
up his books. For my own part, if it was right to look at things so
selfishly, I should say I never was so happy in my life; though I own I
have cried more since coming here than I ever remember before. You will
confess my crosses and losses have been unusual trials, when I tell
you, out of all my makings, and bakings, and brewings, and preservings,
there has been nothing either eatable or drinkable; and what is more
painful to an affectionate mind,&mdash;have half poisoned the whole family
with home-made ketchup of toadstools, by mistake for mushrooms. When I
reflect that they are preserved, I ought not to grieve about my damsons
and bullaces, done by Mrs. Maria Dover’s receipt.</p>

<p>Among other things, we came into a beautiful closet of old china,
which, I am shocked to say, is all destroyed by my preserving. The
bullaces and damsons fermented, and blew up a great jar with a violent
shock that smashed all the tea and coffee cups, and left nothing but
the handles hanging in rows on the tenter-hooks. But to a resigned
spirit there’s always some comfort in calamities, and if the preserves
work and ferment so, there’s some hope that my beer will, as it has
been a month next Monday in the mash tub. As for the loss of the
elder wine, candour compels me to say it was my own fault for letting
the poor blind little animals crawl into the copper; but experience
dictates next year not to boil the berries and kittens at the same time.</p>

<p>I mean to attempt cream cheese as soon as we can get cream,&mdash;but as yet
we can’t drive the Cows home to be milked for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Bull&mdash;he has twice
hunted Grace and me into fits, and kept my poor Mother a whole morning
in the pigsty. As I know you like country delicacies, you will receive
a pound of my fresh butter when it comes, and I mean to add a cheese as
soon as I can get one to stick together. I shall send also some family
pork for Governess, of our own killing, as we wring a pig’s neck on
Saturday. I did hope to give you the unexpected treat of a home-made
loaf, but it was forgot in the oven from ten till six, and so too black
to offer. However, I hope to surprise you with one by Monday’s carrier.
Anastasia bids me add she will send a nosegay for respected Mrs.
Tombleson, if the plants don’t die off before, which I am sorry to say
is not improbable.</p>

<p>It’s really shocking to see the failure of her cultivated taste, and
one in particular, that must be owned a very pretty idea. When we
came, there was a vast number of flower roots, but jumbled without any
regular order, till Anastasia trowelled them all up, and set them in
again, in the quadrille figures. It must have looked sweetly elegant,
if it had agreed with them, but they have all dwindled and drooped like
deep declines and consumptions. Her dahlias and tulips too have turned
out nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> onions and kidney potatoes, and her ten week stocks
have not come up in twenty. But as Shakspeare says, Adversity is a
precious toad&mdash;that teaches us Patience is a jewel.</p>

<p>Considering the unsettled state of coming in, I must conclude, but
could not resist giving your friendliness a short account of the happy
change that has occurred, and our increase of comforts. I would write
more, but I know you will excuse my listening to the calls of dumb
animals. It’s the time I always scald the little pigs’ bread and milk,
and put saucers of clean water for the ducks and geese. There are the
fowls’ beds to make with fresh straw, and a hundred similar things that
country people are obliged to think of.</p>

<p>The children, I am happy to say, are all well, only baby is a little
fractious, we think from Grace setting him down in the nettles, and
he was short-coated last week. Grace is poorly with a cold, and
Anastasia has got a sore throat, from sitting up fruitlessly in the
orchard to hear the nightingale; perhaps there may not be any in the
Fens. I seem to have a trifling ague and rheumatism myself, but it
may be only a stiffness from so much churning, and the great family
wash-up of everything we had directly we came down, for the sake of
grass-bleaching on the lawn. With these exceptions, we are all in
perfect health and happiness, and unite in love, with</p>

<p>In my ultimatum I informed of old Wrigglesworth paying his natural
debts, and of the whole Middlefen estate coming from Lincolnshire to
Barbican. I charged Mr. P. to send bulletings into you with progressive
reports, but between sisters, as I know you are very curious, I am
going to make myself more particular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> I take the opportunity of the
family being all restive in bed, and the house all still, to give an
account of our moving. The things all got here safe, with the exception
of the Crockery and Glass, which came down with the dresser, about an
hour after its arrival. Perhaps if we hadn’t overloaded it with the
whole of our breakables, it wouldn’t have given way,&mdash;as it is, we
have only one plate left, and that’s chipt, and a mug without a spout
to keep it in countenance. Our furniture, &amp;c., came by the waggon, and
I am sorry to say a poor family at the same time, and the little idle
boys with their knives have carved and scarified my rosewood legs,
and, what is worse, not of the same patterns; but as people say, two
Lincolnshire removes are as bad as a fire of London.</p>

<p>The first thing I did on coming down, was to see to the sweeps going
up,&mdash;but I wish I had been less precipitous, for the sooty wretches
stole four good flitches of bacon, as was up the kitchen chimbly,
quite unbeknown to me. We have filled up the vacancy with more, which
smoked us dreadfully, but what is to be cured must be endured. My next
thing was to have all holes and corners cleared out, and washed, and
scrubbed, being left, like bachelor’s places, in a sad state by old
single W.; for a rich man, I never saw one that wanted so much cleaning
out. There were heaps of dung about, as high as haystacks, and it
cost me five shillings a load to have it all carted off the premises;
besides heaps of good-for-nothing littering straw, that I gave to the
boys for bonfires. We are not all to rights yet, but Rome wasn’t built
in St. Thomas’s Day.</p>

<p>It was providential I hampered myself with cold provisions, for except
the bacon there were no eatables in the house. What old W. lived upon
is a mystery, except salads, for we found a whole field of beet-root,
which, all but a few plants for Dorothy to pickle, I had chucked away.
As the ground was then clear for sowing up a crop, I directed George
to plough it up, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> met with agricultural distress. He says as
soon as he whipped his horses, the plough stuck its nose in the earth,
and tumbled over head and heels. It seems very odd when ploughing is
so easy to look at, but I trust he will do better in time. Experience
makes a King Solomon of a Tom Noddy.</p>

<p>I expect we shall have bushels upon bushels of corn, tho’ sadly pecked
by the birds, as I have had all the scarecrows taken down for fear of
the children dreaming of them for Bogies. For the same dear little
sakes I have had the well filled up, and the nasty sharp iron spikes
drawn out of all the rakes and harrows. Nobody shall say to my teeth,
I am not a good Mother. With these precautions I trust the young ones
will enjoy the country when the gipsies have left, but till then, I
confine them to round the house, as it’s no use shutting the stable
door after you’ve had a child stole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>We have a good many fine fields of hay, which I mean to have reaped
directly, wet or shine; for delays are as dangerous as pickles in
glazed pans. Perhaps St. Swithin’s is in our favour, for if the
stacks are put up dampish they won’t catch fire so easily, if Swing
should come into these parts. The poor boys have made themselves
very industrious in shooting off the birds, and hunting away all the
vermin, besides cutting down trees. As I knew it was profitable to fell
timber, I directed them to begin with a very ugly straggling hollow
tree next the premises, but it fell the wrong way, and knocked down the
cow-house. Luckily the poor animals were all in the clover-field at
the time. George says it wouldn’t have happened but for a violent sow,
or rather sow-west,&mdash;and it’s likely enough, but it’s an ill wind that
blows nothing to nobody.</p>

<p>Having writ last post to Mr P., I have no occasion to make you a
country commissioner. Anastasia, indeed, wants to have books about
everything, but for my part and Dorothy’s we don’t put much faith in
authorised receipts and directions, but trust more to nature and common
sense. For instance, in fatting a goose, reason points to sage and
onions,&mdash;why our own don’t thrive on it, is very mysterious. We have a
beautiful poultry yard, only infested with rats,&mdash;but I have made up a
poison, that, I know by the poor ducks, will kill them if they eat it.</p>

<p>I expected to send you a quantity of wall-fruit, for preserving, and
am sorry you bought the brandy beforehand, as it has all vanished in
one night by picking and stealing, notwithstanding I had ten dozen
of bottles broke on purpose to stick a-top of the wall. But I rather
think they came over the pales, as George, who is very thoughtless,
had driven in all the new tenter-hooks with the points downwards. Our
apples and pears would have gone too, but luckily we heard a noise in
the dark and threw brickbats out of window, that alarmed the thieves
by smashing the cowcumber frames. However, I mean on Monday to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
sure of the orchard, by gathering the trees,&mdash;a pheasant in one’s
hand is worth two cock sparrows in a bush. One comfort is, the house
dog is very vicious, and won’t let any of us stir in or out after
dark&mdash;indeed, nothing can be more furious, except the bull, and at me
in particular. You would think he knew my inward thoughts, and that I
intend to have him roasted whole when we give our grand house-warming
regalia. With these particulars, I remain, with love, my dear Dorcas,
your affectionate sister,</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have only one anxiety here, and that is, the likelihood
of being taken violently ill, nine miles off from any physical
powers, with nobody that can ride in the house, and nothing but an
insurmountable hunting horse in the stable. I should like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> therefore,
to be well doctor-stuff’d from Apothecaries’ Hall, by the waggon or any
other vehicle. A stitch in the side taken in time saves nine spasms.

shoe to his foot, and no coat at all, as was supposed to be with the
approbation of parents. It appears that not supposing the distance
between the families extended to him, he walked the whole way down
on the footing of a friend, to visit my son Richard, but hearing the
newspapers read, quitted suddenly, the same day with the gipsies, and
we haven’t an idea what is become of him. Trusting this statement will

<p>My favour of the present date, is to advise of my safe arrival
on Wednesday night, per opposition coach, after ninety miles of
discomfort, absolutely unrivalled for cheapness, and a walk of five
miles more, through lanes and roads, that for dirt and sludge may
confidently defy competition,&mdash;not to mention turnings and windings,
too numerous to particularise, but morally impossible to pursue on
undeviating principles. The night was of so dark a quality as forbade
finding the gate, but for the house-dog flying upon me by mistake for
the late respectable proprietor, and almost tearing my clothes off my
back by his strenuous exertions to obtain the favour of my patronage.</p>

<p>Conscientiously averse to the fallacious statements so much indulged
in by various competitors, truth urges to acknowledge that on arrival,
I did not find things on such a footing as to ensure universal
satisfaction. Mrs. P., indeed, differs in her statement, but you know
her success always surpassed the most sanguine expectations. Ever
emulous to merit commendation by the strictest regard to principles
of economy, I found her laid up with lumbago, through her studious
efforts to please, and Doctor Clarke of Wisbeach in the house
prescribing for it, but I am sorry to add&mdash;no abatement. Dorothy is
also confined to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> bed, by her unremitting assiduity and attention
in the housekeeping line, and Anastasia the same, from listening for
nightingales, on a fine July evening, but which is an article not
always to be warranted to keep its virtue in any climate,&mdash;the other
children, large and small sizes, ditto, ditto, with Grace too ill to
serve in the nursery,&mdash;and the rest of the servants totally unable to
execute such extensive demands. Such an unprecedented depreciation in
health makes me doubt the quality of country air, so much recommended
for family use, and whether constitutions have not more eligibility to
offer that have been regularly town-made.</p>

<p>Our new residence is a large lonely Mansion, with no connexion with any
other House, but standing in the heart of Lincolnshire fens, over which
it looks through an advantageous opening: comprising a great variety of
windmills, and drains, and willow-pollards, and an extensive assortment
of similar articles, that are not much calculated to invite inspection.
In warehouses for corn, &amp;c., it probably presents unusual advantages
to the occupier, but candour compels to state that agriculture in this
part of Lincolnshire is very flat. To supply language on the most
moderate terms, unexampled distress in Spitalfields is nothing to the
distress in ours. The corn has been deluged with rain of remarkable
durability, without being able to wash the smut out of its ears; and
with regard to the expected great rise in hay, our stacks have been
burnt down to the ground, instead of going to the consumer. If the
hounds hadn’t been out, we might have fetch’d the engines, but the
hunter threw George on his head, and he only revived to be sensible
that the entire stock had been disposed of at an immense sacrifice.
The whole amount I fear will be out of book,&mdash;as the Norwich Union
refuses to liquidate the hay, on the ground that the policy was voided
by the impolicy of putting it up wet. In other articles I am sorry I
must write no altera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>tion. Our bull, after killing the house-dog, and
tossing William, has gone wild, and had the madness to run away from
his livelihood, and, what is worse, all the cows after him&mdash;except
those that had burst themselves in the clover field, and a small
dividend, as I may say, of one in the pound. Another item, the pigs,
to save bread and milk, have been turned into the woods for acorns,
and is an article producing no returns&mdash;as not one has yet come back.
Poultry ditto. Sedulously cultivating an enlarged connexion in the
Turkey line, such the antipathy to gipsies, the whole breed, geese
and ducks inclusive, removed themselves from the premises by night,
directly a strolling camp came and set up in the neighbourhood. To
avoid prolixity, when I came to take stock, there was no stock to
take&mdash;namely, no eggs, no butter, no cheese, no corn, no hay, no bread,
no beer&mdash;no water even&mdash;nothing but the mere commodious premises,
and fixtures and goodwill&mdash;and candour compels to add, a very small
quantity on hand of the last-named particular.</p>

<p>To add to stagnation, neither of my two sons in the business nor the
two apprentices have been so diligently punctual in executing country
orders with despatch and fidelity, as laudable ambition desires, but
have gone about fishing and shooting&mdash;and William has suffered a loss
of three fingers, by his unvarying system of high charges. He and
Richard are likewise both threatened with prosecution for trespassing
on the Hares in the adjoining landed interest, and Nick is obliged to
decline any active share, by dislocating his shoulder in climbing a
tall tree for a tom-tit. As for George, tho’ for the first time beyond
the circumscribed limits of town custom, he indulges vanity in such
unqualified pretensions to superiority of knowledge in farming, on the
strength of his grandfather having belonged to the agricultural line
of trade, as renders a wholesale stock of patience barely adequate
to meet its demands. Thus stimulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> to injudicious performance he
is as injurious to the best interests of the country, as blight and
mildew, and smut and rot, and glanders, and pip, all combined in one
texture. Between ourselves, the objects of unceasing endeavours,
united with uncompromising integrity, have been assailed with so much
deterioration, as makes me humbly desirous of abridging sufferings,
by resuming business as a Shoe Marter at the old established House.
If Clack &amp; Son, therefore, have not already taken possession and
respectfully informed the vicinity, will thankfully pay reasonable
compensation for loss of time and expense incurred by the bargain
being off. In case parties agree, I beg you will authorise Mr. Robins
to have the honour to dispose of the whole Lincolnshire concern, tho’
the knocking down of Middlefen Hall will be a severe blow on Mrs. P.
and Family. Deprecating the deceitful stimulus of advertising arts,
interest commands to mention,&mdash;desirable freehold estate and eligible
investment&mdash;and sole reason for disposal, the proprietor going to
the continent. Example suggests likewise, a good country for hunting
for fox-hounds&mdash;and a prospect too extensive to put in a newspaper.
Circumstances being rendered awkward by the untoward event of the
running away of the cattle, &amp;c., it will be best to say&mdash;“The Stock
to be taken as it stands;”&mdash;and an additional favour will be politely
conferred, and the same thankfully acknowledged, if the auctioneer will
be so kind as bring the next market town ten miles nearer and carry the
coach and the waggon once a day past the door. Earnestly requesting
early attention to the above, and with sentiments of, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right mright1">R. P<span class="smaller">UGSLEY</span>, Sen.</p>

<p>P.S. Richard is just come to hand dripping and half dead out of the
Nene, and the two apprentices all but drowned each other in saving him.
Hence occurs to add, fishing opportunities among the desirable items.</p>

<p class="p0 mleft1">D<span class="smaller">EAR</span> B<span class="smaller">ROTHER</span>,</p>

<p>Here we are, thank Providence, safe and well, and in the finest country
you ever saw. At this moment I have before me the sublime expanse of
Squampash Flatts&mdash;the majestic Mudiboo winding through the midst&mdash;with
the magnificent range of the Squab mountains in the distance. But the
prospect is impossible to describe in a letter! I might as well attempt
a Panorama in a pill-box!</p>

<p>We have fixed our Settlement on the left bank of the river. In
crossing the rapids we lost most of our heavy baggage and all our
iron work, but by great good fortune we saved Mrs. Paisley’s grand
piano and the children’s toys. Our infant city consists of three log
huts and one of clay, which, however, on the second day, fell in to
the ground landlords. We have now built it up again;&mdash;and, all things
considered, are as comfortable as we could expect&mdash;and have christened
our settlement New London, in compliment to the Old Metropolis. We
have one of the log houses to ourselves&mdash;or at least shall have when
we have built a new hog-sty. We burnt down the first one in making a
bonfire to keep off the wild beasts, and for the present the pigs are
in the parlour. As yet our rooms are rather usefully than elegantly
furnished. We have gutted the Grand Upright, and it makes a convenient
cupboard,&mdash;the chairs were obliged to blaze at our bivouacs, but thank
Heaven we have never leisure to sit down, and so do not miss them.
My boys are contented, and will be well when they have got over some
awkward accidents in lopping and felling. Mrs. P. grumbles a little,
but it is her custom to lament most when she is in the midst of
comforts. She complains of solitude, and says she could enjoy the very
stiffest of stiff visits.</p>

<p>The first time we lighted a fire in our new abode, a large serpent came
down the chimney, which I looked upon as a good omen. However, as Mrs.
P. is not partial to snakes, and the heat is supposed to attract those
reptiles, we have dispensed with fires ever since. As for wild beasts,
we hear them howling and roaring round the fence every night from dusk
till daylight, but we have only been inconvenienced by one Lion. The
first time he came, in order to get rid of the brute peaceably, we
turned out an old ewe, with which he was well satisfied;&mdash;but ever
since he comes to us as regular as clock-work for his mutton; and if
we do not soon contrive to cut his acquaintance, we shall hardly have
a sheep in the flock. It would have been easy to shoot him, being well
provided with muskets, but Barnaby mistook our remnant of gunpowder
for onion seed, and sowed it all in the kitchen garden. We did try to
trap him into a pitfall; but after twice catching Mrs. P., and every
one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> children in turn, it was given up. They are now, however,
perfectly at ease about the animal, for they never stir out of doors
at all, and to make them quite comfortable, I have blocked up all the
windows and barricaded the door.</p>

<p>We have lost only one of our number since we came; namely, Diggory, the
market gardener, from Glasgow, who went out one morning to botanise,
and never came back. I am much surprised at his absconding, as he
had nothing but a spade to go off with. Chippendale, the carpenter,
was sent after him, but did not return; and Gregory, the smith, has
been out after them these two days. I have just despatched Mudge,
the Herdsman, to look for all three, and hope he will soon give a
good account of them, as they are the most useful men in the whole
settlement, and, in fact, indispensable to its existence.</p>

<p>The river Mudiboo is deep, and rapid, and said to swarm with
alligators, though I have heard but of three being seen at one
time, and none of those above eighteen feet long; this however, is
immaterial, as we do not use the river fluid, which is thick and dirty,
but draw all our water from natural wells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> and tanks. Poisonous springs
are rather common, but are easily distinguished by containing no fish
or living animal. Those, however, which swarm with frogs, toads, newts,
efts, &amp;c., are harmless, and may be safely used for culinary purposes.</p>

<p>In short, I know of no drawback but one, which, I am sanguine, may be
got over hereafter, and do earnestly hope and advise, if things are
no better in England than when I left, you, and as many as you can
persuade, will sell off all, and come over to this African Paradise.</p>

<p>The drawback I speak of is this: although I have never seen any one of
the creatures, it is too certain that the mountains are inhabited by a
race of Monkeys, whose cunning and mischievous talents exceed even the
most incredible stories of their tribe. No human art or vigilance seems
of avail; we have planned ambuscades, and watched night after night,
but no attempt has been made; yet the moment the guard was relaxed, we
were stripped without mercy. I am convinced they must have had spies
night and day on our motions, yet so secretly and cautiously, that no
glimpse of one has yet been seen by any of our people. Our last crop
was cut and carried off, with the precision of an English Harvesting.
Our spirit stores&mdash;(you will be amazed to hear that these creatures
pick locks with the dexterity of London burglars)&mdash;have been broken
open and ransacked, though half the establishment were on the watch;
and the brutes have been off to their mountains, five miles distant,
without even the dogs giving an alarm. I could almost persuade myself
at times, such are their supernatural knowledge, swiftness, and
invisibility, that we have to contend with evil spirits. I long for
your advice, to refer to on this subject, and am,</p>

<p>P.S. Since writing the above, you will be concerned to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> the body
of poor Diggory has been found, horribly mangled by wild beasts. The
fate of Chippendale, Gregory, and Mudge, is no longer doubtful. The old
Lion has brought the Lioness, and the sheep being all gone, they have
made a joint attack upon the Bullock-house. The Mudiboo has overflowed,
and Squampash Flatts are a swamp. I have just discovered that the
Monkeys are my own rascals, that I brought out from England. We are
coming back as fast as we can.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>H<span class="smaller">E</span> was evidently a foreigner, and poor. As I sat at the opposite corner
of the Southgate stage, I took a mental inventory of his wardrobe.
A military cloak much the worse for wear,&mdash;a blue coat, the worse
for tear,&mdash;a napless hat&mdash;a shirt neither white nor brown&mdash;a pair of
mud-colour gloves, open at each thumb&mdash;gray trousers too short for his
legs&mdash;and brown boots too long for his feet.</p>

<p>From some words he dropt, I found that he had come direct from Paris,
to undertake the duties of French teacher, at an English academy; and
his companion, the English classical usher, had been sent to London, to
meet and conduct him to his suburban destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor devil, thought I, thou art going into a bitter bad line
of business; and the hundredth share which I had taken in the
boyish persecutions of my own French master&mdash;an emigré of the old
noblesse&mdash;smote violently on my conscience. At Edmonton the coach
stopped. The coachman alighted, pulled the bell of a mansion inscribed
in large letters, Vespasian House; and deposited the foreigner’s trunks
and boxes on the footpath. The English classical usher stepped briskly
out, and deposited a shilling in the coachman’s anticipatory hand.
Monsieur followed the example, and with some precipitation prepared to
enter the gate of the fore-garden, but the driver stood in the way.</p>

<p>“I want another shilling,” said the coachman.</p>

<p>“You agreed to take a shilling a-head,” said the English master.</p>

<p>“You said you would take one shilling for my head,” said the French
master.</p>

<p>“It’s for the luggage,” said the coachman.</p>

<p>The Frenchman seemed thunderstruck; but there was no help for
it. He pulled out a small weasel-bellied, brown silk purse, but
there was nothing in it save a medal of Napoleon. Then he felt his
breast-pockets, then his side-pockets, and then his waistcoat-pockets;
but they were all empty, excepting a metal snuff-box, and that was
empty too. Lastly he felt the pockets in the flaps of his coat, taking
out a meagre would-be white handkerchief, and shaking it; but not a
dump. I rather suspect he anticipated the result&mdash;but he went thro’ the
operations <i>seriatim</i>, with the true French gravity. At last he turned
to his companion, with a “Mistare Barbiere, be as good to lend me one
shilling.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barber, thus appealed to, went through something of the same
ceremony. Like a blue-bottle cleaning itself, he passed his hands over
his breast&mdash;round his hips, and down the outside of his thighs,&mdash;but
the sense of feeling could detect nothing like a coin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>“You agreed for a shilling, and you shall have no more,” said the man
with empty pockets.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;you shall have no more,” said the moneyless Frenchman.</p>

<p>By this time the housemaid of Vespasian House, tired of standing with
the door in her hand, had come down to the garden-gate, and, willing to
make herself generally useful, laid her hand on one of the Foreigner’s
trunks.</p>

<p>“It shan’t go till I’m paid my shilling,” said the coachman, taking
hold of the handle at the other end.</p>

<p>The good-natured housemaid instantly let go of the trunk, and seemed
suddenly to be bent double by a violent cramp, or stitch, in her right
side,&mdash;while her hand groped busily under her gown. But it was in vain.
There was nothing in that pocket but some curl-papers, and a brass
thimble.</p>

<p>The stitch or cramp then seemed to attack her other side; again she
stooped and fumbled, while Hope and Doubt struggled together on her
rosy face. At last Hope triumphed,&mdash;from the extremest corner of
the huge dimity pouch she fished up a solitary coin, and thrust it
exultingly into the obdurate palm.</p>

<p>“It won’t do,” said the coachman, casting a wary eye on the metal, and
holding out for the inspection of the trio a silver-washed coronation
medal, which had been purchased of a Jew for twopence the year before.</p>

<p>The poor girl quietly set down the trunk which she had again taken up,
and restored the deceitful medal to her pocket. In the meantime the
arithmetical usher had arrived at the gate in his way out, but was
stopped by the embargo on the luggage. “What’s the matter now?” asked
the man of figures.</p>

<p>“If you please, Sir,” said the housemaid, dropping a low courtesy,
“it’s this impudent fellow of a coachman will stand here for his

<p>“He wants a shilling more than his fare,” said Mr. Barber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>“He does want more than his fare shilling,” reiterated the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“Coachman! what the devil are we waiting here for?” shouted a
stentorian voice from the rear of the stage.</p>

<p>“Bless me, John, are we to stay here all day?” cried a shrill voice
from the stage’s interior.</p>

<p>“If you don’t get up shortly I shall get down,” bellowed a voice from
the box.</p>

<p>At this crisis the English usher drew his fellow-tutor aside, and
whispered something in his ear that made him go through the old manual
exercise. He slapped his pantaloons&mdash;flapped his coat tails&mdash;and felt
about his bosom&mdash;“I haven’t got one,” said he, and with a shake of the
head and a hurried bow, he set off at the pace of a twopenny postman.</p>

<p>“I a’n’t going to stand here all day,” said the coachman, getting out
of all reasonable patience.</p>

<p>“You’re an infernal scoundrelly villain,” said Mr. Barber, getting out
of all classical English.</p>

<p>“You are a&mdash;what Mr. Barber says,” said the Foreigner.</p>

<p>“Thank God and his goodness,” ejaculated the housemaid, “here comes the
Doctor;” and the portly figure of the pedagogue himself came striding
pompously down the gravel-walk. He had two thick lips and a double
chin, which all began wagging together.</p>

<p>“Well, well; what’s all this argumentative elocution? I command
taciturnity!”</p>

<p>“I’m a shilling short,” said the coachman.</p>

<p>“He says he has got one short shilling,” said the Foreigner.</p>

<p>“Poo&mdash;poo&mdash;poo,” said the thick-lips and double-chin. “Pay the fellow
his superfluous claim, and appeal to magisterial authority.”</p>

<p>“It’s what we mean to do, Sir,” said the English usher, “but”&mdash;and he
laid his lips mysteriously to the Doctor’s ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>“A pecuniary bagatelle,” said the Doctor. “It’s palpable
extortion,&mdash;but I’ll disburse it,&mdash;and you have a legislatorial
remedy for his avaricious demands.” As the man of pomp said this,
he thrust his fore finger into an empty waistcoat-pocket&mdash;then into
its fellow&mdash;and then into every pocket he had&mdash;but without any other
product than a bunch of keys, two ginger lozenges, and the French mark.</p>

<p>“It’s very peculiar,” said the Doctor. “I had a prepossession of having
currency to that amount. The coachman must call to-morrow for it at
Vespasian House&mdash;or stay&mdash;I perceive my housekeeper. Mrs. Plummer! pray
just step hither and liquidate this little commercial obligation.”</p>

<p>Now, whether Mrs. Plummer had or had not a shilling, Mrs. Plummer only
knows; for she did not condescend to make any search for it,&mdash;and if
she had none, she was right not to take the trouble. However, she
attempted to carry the point by a <i>coup de main</i>. Snatching up one of
the boxes, she motioned the housemaid to do the like, exclaiming in
a shrill treble key,&mdash;“Here’s a pretty work indeed, about a paltry
shilling! If it’s worth having, it’s worth calling again for,&mdash;and I
suppose Vespasian House is not going to run away!”</p>

<p>“But may be I am,” said the inflexible coachman, seizing a trunk with
each hand.</p>

<p>“John, I insist on being let out,” screamed the lady in the coach. “I
shall be too late for dinner,” roared the Thunderer in the dickey. As
for the passenger on the box, he had made off during the latter part of
the altercation.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” said the English Classical Usher.</p>

<p>“God and his goodness only knows!” said the housemaid.</p>

<p>“I am a stranger in this country,” said the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“You must pay the money,” said the coachman.</p>

<p>“And here it is, you brute,” said Mrs. Plummer, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> made a trip to
the house in the meantime; but whether she had coined it, or raised it
by a subscription among the pupils, I know no more than</p>

master.”&mdash;O<span class="smaller">LD</span> S<span class="smaller">PELLING</span> B<span class="smaller">OOK</span>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>M<span class="smaller">Y</span> old Schoolmaster is dead. He “died of a stroke;” and I wonder
none of his pupils have ever done the same. I have been flogged by
many masters, but his rod, like Aaron’s, swallowed up all the rest.
We have often wished that he whipped on the principle of Italian
penmanship,&mdash;up strokes heavy and down strokes light; but he did it in
English round hand, and we used to think with a very hard pen. Such was
his love of flogging, that for some failure in English composition,
after having been well corrected I have been ordered to be revised.
I have heard of a road to learning, and he did justice to it; we
certainly never went a stage in education without being well horsed.
The mantle of Dr. Busby descended on his shoulders, and on ours. There
was but one tree in the play-ground&mdash;a birch, but it never had a twig
or leaf upon it. Spring or summer it always looked as bare as if the
weather had been cutting at the latter end of the year. Pictures they
say are incentives to learning, and certainly we never got through a
page without cuts; for instance, I do not recollect a Latin article
without a tail-piece. All the Latin at that school might be comprised
in one line&mdash;</p>

<p class="s5 center">“Arma virumque cano.”</p>

<p>An arm, a man, and a cane. It was Englished to me one day in school
hours, when I was studying Robinson Crusoe instead of Virgil, by a
storm of bamboo that really carried on the illusion, and made me think
for the time that I was assaulted by a set of savages. He seemed to
consider a boy as a bear’s cub, and set himself literally to lick him
into shape. He was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> particularly fond of striking us with a leather
strap on the flats of our hands that he never allowed them a day’s
rest. There was no such thing as a Palm Sunday in our calendar. In one
word, he was disinterestedly cruel, and used as industriously to strike
for nothing as other workmen strike for wages. Some of the elder boys,
who had read Smollett, christened him Roderick, from his often hitting
like Random, and being so partial to Strap.</p>

<p>His death was characteristic. After making his will he sent for Mr.
Taddy, the head usher, and addressed him as follows: “It is all over,
Mr. Taddy&mdash;I am sinking fast&mdash;I am going from the terrestrial globe&mdash;to
the celestial&mdash;and have promised Tomkins a flogging&mdash;mind he has
it&mdash;and don’t let him pick off the buds&mdash;I have asked Aristotle”&mdash;(here
his head wandered)&mdash;“and he says I cannot live an hour&mdash;I don’t like
that black horse grinning at me&mdash;cane him soundly for not knowing
his verbs&mdash;Castigo te, non quod odio habeam&mdash;Oh, Mr. Taddy, it’s
breaking up with me&mdash;the vacation’s coming&mdash;There is that black horse
again&mdash;Dulcis moriens reminiscitur&mdash;we are short of canes&mdash;Mr. Taddy,
don’t let the school get into disorder when I am gone&mdash;I’m afraid,
through my illness&mdash;the boys have gone back in their flogging&mdash;I feel
a strange feeling all over me&mdash;Is the new pupil come?&mdash;I trust I have
done my duty&mdash;and have made my will&mdash;and left all”&mdash;(here his head
wandered again)&mdash;“to Mr. Souter, the school bookseller&mdash;Mr. Taddy, I
invite you to my funeral&mdash;make the boys walk in good order&mdash;and take
care of the crossings.&mdash;My sight is getting dim&mdash;write to Mrs. B. at
Margate&mdash;and inform her&mdash;we break up on the 21st.&mdash;The school-door
is left open&mdash;- I am very cold&mdash;where is my ruler gone&mdash;I will make
him feel&mdash;John, light the school lamps&mdash;I cannot see a line&mdash;Oh Mr.
Taddy&mdash;venit hora&mdash;my hour is come&mdash;I am dying&mdash;thou art dying&mdash;he&mdash;is
dying.&mdash;We&mdash;are&mdash;dying&mdash;you&mdash;are&mdash;dy”&mdash;&mdash;The voice ceased. He made
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> feeble motion with his hands, as if in the act of ruling a
copy-book&mdash;“the <i>ruling</i> passion strong in death”&mdash;and expired.</p>

<p>An epitaph, composed by himself, was discovered in his desk,&mdash;with an
unpublished pamphlet against Tom Paine. The Epitaph was so stuffed
with quotations from Homer and Virgil, and almost every Greek or Latin
author beside, that the mason who was consulted by the Widow declined
to lithograph it under a Hundred Pounds. The Dominie consequently
reposes under no more Latin than H<span class="smaller">IC</span> J<span class="smaller">ACET</span>;&mdash;and without a
single particle of Greek, though he is himself a Long Homer.</p>

<p>In a morning paper justly celebrated for the acuteness of its
reporters, and their almost prophetic insight into character and
motives&mdash;the Rhodian length of their leaps towards results, and the
magnitude of their inferences, beyond the drawing of Moux’s dray
horses,&mdash;there appeared, a few days since, the following paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mansion House. Yesterday, a tall emaciated being, in a brown coat,
indicating his age to be about forty-five, and the raggedness of
which gave a great air of mental ingenuity and intelligence to his
countenance, was introduced by the officers to the Lord Mayor. It was
evident from his preliminary bow that he had made some discoveries in
the art of poetry, which he wished to lay before his Lordship, but the
Lord Mayor perceiving by his accent that he had already submitted his
project to several of the leading Publishers, referred him back to the
same jurisdiction, and the unfortunate Votary of the Muses withdrew,
declaring by another bow, that he should offer his plan to the Editor
of the Comic Annual.”</p>

<p>The unfortunate above referred to, Sir, is myself, and with regard to
the Muses, indeed a votary, though not a £10 one, if the qualification
depends on my pocket&mdash;but for the idea of addressing myself to the
Editor of the Comic Annual, I am indebted solely to the assumption
of the gentlemen of the Press. That I have made a discovery is true,
in common with Hervey, and Herschell, and Galileo, and Roger Bacon,
or rather, I should say, with Columbus,&mdash;my invention concerning a
whole hemisphere, as it were, in the world of poetry&mdash;in short, the
whole continent of blank verse. To an immense number of readers this
literary land has been hitherto a complete terra incognita, and from
one sole reason,&mdash;the want of that harmony which makes the close
of one line chime with the end of another. They have no relish for
numbers that turn up blank, and wonder accordingly at the epithet of
“Prize,” prefixed to Poems of the kind which emanate in&mdash;I was going
to say from&mdash;the University of Oxford. Thus many very worthy members
of society are unable to appreciate the Paradise Lost, the Task, the
Chase, or the Seasons,&mdash;the Winter especially,&mdash;without rhyme. Others,
again, can read the Poems in question, but with a limited enjoyment;
as certain persons can admire the architectural beauties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> of Salisbury
steeple, but would like it better with a ring of bells. For either
of these tastes my discovery will provide, without affronting the
palate of any other; for although the lover of rhyme will find in it
a prodigality hitherto unknown, the heroic character of blank verse
will not suffer in the least, but each line will “do as it likes with
its own,” and sound as independently of the next as “milkmaid,” and
“water-carrier.” I have the honour to subjoin a specimen&mdash;and if,
through your publicity, Mr. Murray should be induced to make me an
offer for an Edition of Paradise Lost on this principle, for the Family
Library, it will be an eternal obligation on,</p>

<p>A<span class="smaller">LL</span> at once Miss Morbid left off sugar.</p>

<p>She did not resign it as some persons lay down their carriage, the
full-bodied family-coach dwindling into a chariot, next into a fly, and
then into a sedan-chair. She did not shade it off artistically, like
certain household economists, from white to white-brown, brown, dark
brown, and so on, to none at all.&mdash;She left it off, as one might leave
off walking on the top of a house, or on a slide, or on a plank with
a further end to it, that is to say, slapdash, all at once, without a
moment’s warning. She gave it up, to speak appropriately, in the lump.
She dropped it&mdash;as Corporal Trim let fall his hat,&mdash;dab. It vanished,
as the French say, <i>toot sweet</i>. From the 30th of November, 1830, not
an ounce of sugar, to use Miss Morbid’s own expression, ever “darkened
her doors.”</p>

<p>The truth was she had been present the day before at an Anti-Slavery
Meeting; and had listened to a lecturing Abolitionist, who had drawn
her sweet tooth, root and branch, out of her head. Thenceforth sugar,
or as she called it “shugger,” was no longer white, or brown, in her
eyes, but red, blood-red&mdash;an abomination, to indulge in which would
convert a professing Christian into a practical Cannibal. Accordingly
she made a vow, under the influence of moist eyes and refined feelings,
that the sanguinary article should never more enter her lips or her
house; and this petty parody of the famous Berlin Decree against our
Colonial produce was rigidly enforced. However others might countenance
the practice of the Slave Owners by consuming “shugger,” she was
resolved, for her own part, that “no suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> sable son of Africa
should ever rise up against her out of a cup of Tea!”</p>

<p>In the mean time, the cook and housemaid grumbled in concert at the
prohibition: they naturally thought it very hard to be deprived of a
luxury which they enjoyed at their own proper cost; and at last only
consented to remain in the service, on condition that the privation
should be handsomely considered in their wages.</p>

<p>With a hope of being similarly remembered in her will, the poor
relations of Miss Morbid continued to drink the “warm without,”
which she administered to them every Sunday, under the name of Tea:
and Hogarth would have desired no better subject for a picture than
was presented by their physiognomies. Some pursed up their lips,
as if resolved that the nauseous beverage should never enter them;
others compressed their mouths, as if to prevent it from rushing out
again. One took it mincingly, in sips,&mdash;another gulped it down in
desperation,&mdash;a third, in a fit of absence, continued to stir very
superfluously with his spoon; and there was one shrewd old gentleman,
who by a little dexterous by-play, used to bestow the favour of his
small souchong on a sick geranium. Now and then an astonished Stranger
would retain a half cupful of the black dose in his mouth, and stare
round at his fellow guests, as if tacitly putting to them the very
question of Mathews’s Yorkshireman in the mail coach&mdash;“Coompany!&mdash;oop
or doon?”</p>

<p>The greatest sufferers, however, were Miss Morbid’s two nephews, still
in the morning of their youth, and boy-like, far more inclined to
“sip the sweets” than to “hail the dawn.” They had formerly looked on
their Aunt’s house as peculiarly a Dulce Domum. Prior to her sudden
conversion she had been famous for the manufacture of a sort of hard
bake, commonly called Toffy or Taffy,&mdash;but now, alas! “Taffy was not
at home,” and there was nothing else to invite a call. Currant tart
is tart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> indeed without sugar; and as for the green gooseberries,
they always tasted, as the young gentlemen affirmed, “like a quart
of berries sharpened to a pint.” In short it always required six
pennyworth of lollipops and bullseyes, a lick of honey, a dip of
treacle, and a pick at a grocer’s hogshead, to sweeten a visit at Aunt
Morbid’s.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, her own temper soured a little under the
prohibition. She could not persuade the sugar-eaters that they were
Vampyres;&mdash;instead of practising, or even admiring her self-denial,
they laughed at it; and one wicked wag even compared her, in allusion
to her acerbity and her privation, to a crab without <i>the nippers</i>.
She persevered notwithstanding in her system; and to the constancy
of a martyr added something of the wilfulness of a bigot:&mdash;indeed,
it was hinted by patrons and patronesses of white charities, that
European objects had not their <i>fair</i> share in her benevolence. She
was pre-eminently the friend of the blacks. Howbeit, for all her
sacrifices, not a lash was averted from their sable backs. She had
raised discontent in the kitchen, she had disgusted her acquaintance,
sickened her friends, and given her own dear little nephews the
stomach-ache, without saving Quashy from one cut of the driver’s
whip, or diverting a single kick from the shins of Sambo. Her grocer
complained loudly of being called a dealer in human gore, yet not one
hogshead the less was imported from the Plantations. By an error common
to all her class she mistook a negative for a positive principle; and
persuaded herself that by <i>not</i> preserving damsons, she preserved the
Niggers; that by <i>not</i> sweetening her own cup, she was dulcifying the
lot of all her sable brethren in bondage. She persevered accordingly in
setting her face against sugar instead of slavery; against the plant
instead of the planter; and had actually abstained for six months from
the forbidden article, when a circumstance occurred that roused her
sympathies into more active exertions. It pleased an American lady
to import<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> with her a black female servant, whom she rather abruptly
dismissed, on her arrival in England. The case was considered by the
Hampshire Telegraph of that day, as one of G<span class="smaller">REAT</span> H<span class="smaller">ARDSHIP</span>; the
paragraph went the round of the papers and in due time attracted the
notice of Miss Morbid. It was precisely addressed to her sensibilities,
and there was a “Try Warren” tone about it that proved irresistible.
She read&mdash;and wrote&mdash;and in the course of one little week, her domestic
establishment was maliciously but truly described as consisting of “two
white Slaves and a black Companion.”</p>

<p>The adopted protégé was, in reality, a strapping clumsy Negress, as
ugly as sin, and with no other merit than that of being of the same
colour as the crow. She was artful, sullen, gluttonous, and above
all so intolerably indolent, that if she had been literally “carved
in ebony,” as old Fuller says, she could scarcely have been of less
service to her protectress. Her notion of Free Labour seemed to
translate it into laziness, and taking liberties; and, as she seriously
added to the work of her fellow-servants, without at all contributing
to their comfort, they soon looked upon her as a complete nuisance.
The housemaid dubbed her “a Divil,”&mdash;the cook roundly compared her to
“a mischivus beast, as runs out on a herd o’ black cattle;”&mdash;and both
concurred in the policy of laying all household sins upon the sooty
shoulders&mdash;just as slatterns select a colour that hides the dirt.
It is certain that shortly after the instalment of the negress in
the family a moral disease broke out with considerable violence, and
justly or not, the odium was attributed to the new comer. Its name was
theft. First, there was a shilling short in some loose change&mdash;next,
a missing half-crown from the mantelpiece&mdash;then there was a stir with
a tea-spoon&mdash;anon, a piece of work about a thimble. Things went,
nobody knew how&mdash;the “Divil” of course excepted. The Cook <i>could</i>, the
Housemaid <i>would</i>, and Dinah <i>should</i>, and <i>ought</i> to take an oath,
declaratory of inno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>cence, before the mayor; but as Dinah did not
volunteer an affidavit like the others, there was no doubt of her guilt
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Miss Morbid, however, came to a very different conclusion. She thought
that whites who could eat sugar, were capable of any atrocity, and
had not forgotten the stand which had been made by the “pale faces,”
in favour of the obnoxious article. The cook especially incurred
suspicion; for she had been notorious aforetime for a lavish hand in
sweetening, and was accordingly quite equal to the double turpitude of
stealing and bearing false witness. In fact the mistress had arrived
at the determination of giving both her white hussies their month’s
warning, when unexpectedly the thief was taken, as the lawyers say,
“in the manner,” and with the goods upon the person. In a word the
ungrateful black was detected, in the very act of levying what might be
called her “Black Mail.”</p>

<p>The horror of Emilia, on discovering that the Moor had murdered
her mistress, was scarcely greater than that of Miss Morbid! She
hardly, she said, believed her own senses. You might have knocked
her down with a feather! She did not know whether she stood on her
head or her heels. She was rooted to the spot; and her hair, if it
had been her own, would have stood upright upon her head! There
was no doubt in the case. She saw the transfer of a portion of her
own bank stock, from her escritoire into the right-hand pocket of
her protégé&mdash;she heard it chink as it dropped downwards&mdash;she was
petrified!&mdash;dumbfounded!&mdash;thunderbolted!&mdash;“annilliated!” She was as
white as a sheet, but she felt as if all the blacks in the world had
just blown in her face.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to rush upon the robber, and insist on
restitution&mdash;her second was to sit down and weep,&mdash;and her third was
to talk. The opening as usual was a mere torrent of ejaculations
intermixed with vituperation&mdash;but she gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> fell into a lecture
with many heads. First, she described all that she had done for the
Blacks, and then, alas! all that the Blacks had done for her. Next she
insisted on the enormity of the crime, and, anon, she enlarged on the
nature of its punishment. It was here that she was most eloquent. She
traced the course of human justice, from detection to conviction, and
thence to execution, liberally throwing dissection into the bargain:
and then descending with Dante into the unmentionable regions, she
painted its terrors and tortures with all the circumstantial fidelity
that certain very Old Masters have displayed on the same subject.</p>

<p>“And now, you black wretch,” she concluded, having just given the
finishing touch to a portrait of Satan himself; “and now, you black
wretch, I insist on knowing what I was robbed for. Come, tell me what
tempted you! I’m determined to hear it! I insist, I say, on knowing
what was to be done with the wages of iniquity!”</p>

<p>She insisted, however, in vain. The black wretch had seriously inclined
her ear to the whole lecture, grinning and blubbering by turns. The
Judge with his black cap, the Counsel and their wigs, the twelve
men in a box, and Jack Ketch himself&mdash;whom she associated with that
pleasant West Indian personage, John Canoe&mdash;had amused, nay, tickled
her fancy; the press-room, the irons, the rope, and the Ordinary, whom
she mistook for an overseer, had raised her curiosity, and excited
her fears; but the spiritualities, without any reference to Obeah,
had simply mystified and disgusted her, and she was now in a fit of
the sulks. Her mistress, however, persisted in her question; and not
the less pertinaciously, perhaps, from expecting a new peg whereon to
hang a fresh lecture. She was determined to learn the destination of
the stolen money; and by dint of insisting, cajoling, and, above all,
threatening&mdash;for instance, with the whole Posse Comitatis&mdash;she finally
carried her point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cuss him money! Here’s a fuss!” exclaimed the culprit, quite worn out
at last by the persecution. “Cuss him money! here’s a fuss! What me
’teal him for? What me do wid him? What anybody ’teal him for? Why, for
sure, <i>to buy sugar</i>!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SCHOOLMASTER_ABROAD">THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.</h2>

</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I <span class="smaller">ONCE</span>, for a very short time indeed, had the honour of being a
schoolmaster, and was invested with the important office of “rearing
the tender thought,” and “teaching the young idea how to shoot;” of
educating in the principles of the Established Church, and bestowing
the strictest attention to morals. The case was this; my young friend
G&mdash;&mdash;, a graduate of Oxford, and an ingenious and worthy man, thought
proper, some months back, to establish, or endeavour to establish,
an academy for young gentlemen, in my immediate vicinity. He had
already procured nine day-pupils to begin with, whom he himself
taught,&mdash;prudence as yet prohibiting the employment of ushers,&mdash;when
he was summoned hastily to attend upon a dying relative in Hampshire,
from whom he had some expectations. This was a dilemma to poor G&mdash;&mdash;,
who had no one to leave in charge of his three classes; and he could
not bear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> idea of playing truant himself so soon after commencing
business. In his extremity he applied to me as his forlorn hope, and
one forlorn enough; for it is well-known among my friends that I
have little Latin, and less Greek, and am, on every account, a worse
accountant. I urged these objections to G&mdash;&mdash;, but in vain, for he
had no “friend in need,” learned or unlearned, within any reasonable
distance, and, as he said to comfort me, “in three or four days merely
the boys could not <i>unlearn</i> much of anything.”</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">A BRANCH COACH.</p>
</div>

<p>At last I gave way to his importunity. On Thursday night, he started
from the tree of knowledge by a branch coach; and at nine on Friday
morning, I found myself sitting at his desk in the novel character of
pedagogue. I am sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> to say, not one of the boys played truant, or
was confined at home with a violent illness.&mdash;There they were, nine
little mischievous wretches, goggling, tittering, pointing, winking,
grimacing, and mocking at authority, in a way enough to invoke two
Elisha bears out of Southgate Wood. To put a stop to this indecorum,
I put on my spectacles, stuck my cane upright in the desk, with the
fool’s-cap atop&mdash;but they inspired little terror; worn out at last,
I seized the cane, and rushing from my dais, well flogged&mdash;I believe
it is called flogging&mdash;the boy, a Creole, nearest me; who, though far
from the biggest, was much more daring and impertinent than the rest.
So far my random selection was judicious; but it appeared afterwards,
that I had chastised an only son, whose mother had expressly stipulated
for him an exemption from all punishment. I suspect, with the moral
prudence of fond mothers, she had informed the little imp of the
circumstance, for this Indian-Pickle fought and kicked his preceptor
as unceremoniously as he would have scuffled with Black Diana or
Agamemnon. My first move, however, had a salutary effect; the urchins
settled, or made believe to settle, to their tasks; but I soon
perceived that the genuine industry and application belonged to one,
a clever-looking boy, who, with pen and paper before him, was sitting
at the further end of a long desk, as great a contrast to the others,
as the Good, to the Bad Apprentice in Hogarth. I could see his tongue
even at work at one corner of his mouth,&mdash;a very common sign of boyish
assiduity,&mdash;and his eyes never left his task but occasionally to glance
towards his master, as if in anticipation of the approving smile,
to which he looked forward as the prize of industry. I had already
selected him inwardly for a favourite, and resolved to devote my best
abilities to his instruction, when I saw him hand the paper, with a sly
glance to his neighbour, from whom it passed rapidly down the desk,
accompanied by a running titter, and sidelong looks, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> convinced
me the supposed copy was, indeed, a copy not of “Obey your superiors,”
or “Age commands respect,” but of the head of the college, and, as a
glimpse showed, a head with very ludicrous features. Being somewhat
fatigued with my last execution, I suffered the cane of justice to
sleep, and inflicted the fool’s-cap&mdash;literally the fool’s&mdash;for no clown
in pantomime, the great Grimaldi not excepted, could have made a more
laughter-stirring use of the costume. The little enormities, who only
tittered before, now shouted outright, and nothing but the enchanted
wand of bamboo could flap them into solemnity. Order was restored, for
they saw I was, like Earl Grey, resolved to “stand by my order;” and
while I was deliberating, in some perplexity, how to begin business,
the two biggest boys came forward voluntarily, and standing as much
as they could in a circle, presented themselves, and began to read as
the first Greek class. Mr. Irving may boast of his prophets as much as
he will; but in proportion to the numbers of our congregations, I had
far more reason to be proud of my gabblers in an unknown tongue. I,
of course, discovered no lapsus lingui in the performance, and after
a due course of gibberish, the first class dismissed itself, with a
brace of bows and an evident degree of self-satisfaction at being so
perfect in the present after being so imperfect in the past. I own
this first act of our solemn farce made me rather nervous against the
next, which proved to be the Latin class, and I have no doubt to an
adept would have seemed as much a Latin comedy as those performed at
the Westminster school. We got through the second course quite correct,
as before, and I found, with some satisfaction, that the third was a
dish of English Syntax, where I <i>was</i> able to detect flaws, and the
heaps of errors that I had to arrest made me thoroughly sensible of the
bliss of ignorance in the Greek and Latin. A general lesson in English
reading ensued, through which we glided smoothly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> enough, till we came
to a sandbank in the shape of a Latin quotation, which I was requested
to English. It was something like this:&mdash;“Nemo mortalius omnibus hora
sapit,” which I rendered, “No mortal knows at what hour the omnibus
starts”&mdash;and with this translation the whole school was perfectly
satisfied. Nine more bows.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">A SECOND COURSE.</p>
</div>

<p>My horror now approached: I saw the little wretches lug out their
slates, and begin to cuff out the old sums, a sight that made me wish
all the slates at the roof of the house. I knew very well that when
the army of nine attacked my Bonnycastle, it would not long hold out.
Unluckily, from inexperience, I gave them all the same question to
work, and the consequence was, each brought up a different result&mdash;nor
would my practical knowledge of Practice allow me to judge of their
merits. I had no resource but, Lavater-like, to go by Physiognomy, and
accordingly selected the solution of the most mathematical-looking boy.
But Lavater betrayed me. Master White, a chowder-headed lout of a lad,
as dull as a pig of lead, and as mulishly obstinate as Muley Abdallah,
persisted that his answer was correct, and at last appealed to the
superior authority of a Tutor’s Key, that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> kept by stealth in
his desk. From this instant my importance declined, and the urchins
evidently began to question, with some justice, what right I had to
rule nine, who was not competent to the Rule of Three. By way of a
diversion, I invited my pupils to a walk; but I wish G&mdash;&mdash; had been
more circumstantial in his instructions before he left. Two of the boys
pleaded sick headaches to remain behind; and I led the rest, through
my arithmetical failure, under very slender government, by the most
unfortunate route I could have chosen,&mdash;in fact, past the very windows
of their parents, who complained afterwards, that they walked more like
bears than boys, and that if Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; had drawn lots for one at a
raffle, he could not have been more unfortunate in his new usher.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">DRAWING LOTS.</p>
</div>

<p>To avoid observation, which I did not court, I led them aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> into a
meadow, and pulling out a volume of Paradise Lost, left the boys to
amuse themselves as they pleased. They pleased, accordingly, to get up
a little boxing match, à la Crib and Molineux&mdash;between Master White and
the little Creole, of which I was informed only by a final shout and
a stream of blood that trickled, or treacled, from the flat nose of
the child of colour. Luckily, as I thought, he was near home, whither
I sent him for washing and consolation, and in return for which, in
the course of a quarter of an hour, while still in the field, a black
footman, in powder blue turned up with yellow, brought me the following
note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Col. Christopher informs Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;’s Usher, that as the
vulgar practice of pugilism is allowed at Spring Grove Academy,
Master Adolphus Ferdinand Christopher will in future be educated at
home; particularly as she understands Master C. was punished in the
morning, in a way that only becomes blacks and slaves.&mdash;To the new
Usher at Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;’s.”</p>

</div>

<p>Irritated at this event and its commentary, I resolved to punish Master
White, but Master White was nowhere to be found, having expelled
himself and run away home, where he complained to his parents of the
new usher’s deficiencies, and told the whole story of the sum in
Practice, begging earnestly to be removed from a school where, as he
said, it was impossible for him to improve himself. The prayer of
the petition was heard, and on the morrow, Mr. White’s son was minus
at Spring Grove Academy. Calling in the remainder, I ordered a march
homewards, where I arrived just in time to hear the sham headaches of
the two invalids go off with an alarming explosion&mdash;for they had thus
concerted an opportunity for playing with gunpowder and prohibited
arms. Here was another discharge from the school, for no parents think
that their children look the better without eyebrows, and accordingly,
when they went home for the night, the fathers and mothers resolved to
send them to some other school, where no powder was allowed, except
upon the head of the master. I was too much hurt to resume schooling
after the boys’ bad behaviour, and so gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> a half-holiday; and
never, oh never did I so estimate the blessing of sleep, as on that
night when I closed my eyelids on all my pupils! But, alas! sleep
brought its sorrows:&mdash;I saw boys fighting, flourishing slates, and
brandishing squibs and crackers in my visions; and through all,&mdash;such
is the transparency of dreams,&mdash;I beheld the stern shadow of G&mdash;&mdash;
looking unutterable reproaches.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">“COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.”</p>
</div>

<p>The next morning, with many painful recollections, brought one of
pleasure; I remembered that it was the King’s Birthday, and in a fit
of very sincere loyalty, gave the whole school, alas! reduced by one
half, a whole holiday. Thus I got over the end of the week, and Sunday,
literally a day of rest, was spent by the urchins at their own homes.
It may seem sinful to wish for the death of a fellow-creature, but
I could not help thinking of G&mdash;&mdash;’s relative along with what is
called a happy release; and he really was so kind, as we learned by
an express from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> G&mdash;&mdash;, as to break up just after his arrival, and
that G&mdash;&mdash; consequently would return in time to resume his scholastic
duties on the Monday morning. With infinite pleasure I heard this good
bad news from Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, who never interfered in the classical part
of the house, and was consequently all unconscious of the reduction
in the Spring Grove Establishment. I forged an excuse for immediately
leaving off school; “resigned I kissed the rod” that I resigned, and
as I departed, no master but my own, was overwhelmed by a torrent of
grateful acknowledgments of the service I had done the school, which,
as Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash; protested, could never have got on without me. How it
got on I left G&mdash;&mdash; to discover, and I am told he behaved rather like
Macduff at the loss of his “little ones”&mdash;but luckily, I had given
myself warning before his arrival, and escaped from one porch of the
Academy at that nick of time when the Archodidasculus was entering by
another, perfectly convinced that, however adapted to “live and learn,”
I should never be able to live and teach.</p>

    <div class="verse">A Child as is lost about London streets, and especially Seven Dials, is a needle in a bottle of hay.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">I am all in a quiver&mdash;get out of my sight, do, you wretch, you little Kitty M’Nab!</div>
    <div class="verse">You promised to have half an eye to him, you know you did, you dirty deceitful young drab.</div>
    <div class="verse">The last time as ever I see him, poor thing, was with my own blessed Motherly eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse">Sitting as good as gold in the gutter, a playing at making little dirt pies.</div>
    <div class="verse">I wonder he left the court where he was better off than all the other young boys,</div>
    <div class="verse">With two bricks, an old shoe, nine oyster-shells, and a dead kitten by way of toys.</div>
    <div class="verse">When his Father comes home, and he always comes home as sure as ever the clock strikes one,</div>
    <div class="verse">He’ll be rampant, he will, at his child being lost; and the beef and the inguns not done!</div>
    <div class="verse">La bless you, good folks, mind your own consarns, and don’t be making a mob in the street;</div>
    <div class="verse">Oh Serjeant M’Farlane! you have not come across my poor little boy, have you, in your beat?</div>
    <div class="verse">Do, good people, move on! don’t stand staring at me like a parcel of stupid stuck pigs;</div>
    <div class="verse">Saints forbid! but he’s p’r’aps been inviggled away up a court for the sake of his clothes by the prigs;</div>
    <div class="verse">He’d a very good jacket, for certain, for I bought it myself for a shilling one day in Rag Fair;</div>
    <div class="verse">And his trousers considering not very much patch’d, and red plush, they was once his Father’s best pair.</div>
    <div class="verse">His shirt, it’s very lucky I’d got washing in the tub, or that might have gone with the rest;</div>
    <div class="verse">But he’d got on a very good pinafore with only two slits and a burn on the breast.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">He’d a goodish sort of hat, if the crown was sew’d in, and not quite so much jagg’d at the brim.</div>
    <div class="verse">With one shoe on, and the other shoe is a boot, and not a fit, and you’ll know by that if it’s him.</div>
    <div class="verse">Except being so well dress’d my mind would misgive, some old beggar woman in want of an orphan,</div>
    <div class="verse">Had borrow’d the child to go a begging with, but I’d rather see him laid out in his coffin!</div>
    <div class="verse">Do, good people, move on, such a rabble of boys! I’ll break every bone of ’em I come near,</div>
    <div class="verse">Go home&mdash;you’re spilling the porter&mdash;go home Tommy Jones, go along home with your beer.</div>
    <div class="verse">This day is the sorrowfullest day of my life, ever since my name was Betty Morgan,</div>
    <div class="verse">Them vile Savoyards! they lost him once before all along of following a Monkey and an Organ.</div>
    <div class="verse">Oh my Billy&mdash;my head will turn right round&mdash;if he’s got kiddynapp’d with them Italians,</div>
    <div class="verse">They’ll make him a plaster parish image boy, they will, the outlandish tatterdemalions.</div>
    <div class="verse">Billy&mdash;where are you, Billy?&mdash;I’m as hoarse as a crow, with screaming for ye, you young sorrow!</div>
    <div class="verse">And sha’n’t have half a voice, no more I sha’n’t, for crying fresh herrings to-morrow.</div>
    <div class="verse">Oh Billy, you’re bursting my heart in two, and my life won’t be of no more vally,</div>
    <div class="verse">If I’m to see other folks’ darlins, and none of mine, playing like angels in our alley.</div>
    <div class="verse">And what shall I do but cry out my eyes, when I looks at the old three-legged chair</div>
    <div class="verse">As Billy used to make coach and horses of, and there a’n’t no Billy there!</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">I would run all the wide world over to find him, if I only know’d where to run,</div>
    <div class="verse">Little Murphy, now I remember, was once lost for a month through stealing a penny bun,&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">The Lord forbid of any child of mine! I think it would kill me raily,</div>
    <div class="verse">To find my Bill holdin’ up his little innocent hand at the Old Bailey.</div>
    <div class="verse">For though I say it as oughtn’t, yet I will say, you may search for miles and mileses</div>
    <div class="verse">And not find one better brought up, and more pretty behaved, from one end to t’other of St. Giles’s.</div>
    <div class="verse">And if I called him a beauty, it’s no lie, but only as a Mother ought to speak;</div>
    <div class="verse">You never set eyes on a more handsomer face, only it hasn’t been washed for a week;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">As for hair, tho’ its red, its the most nicest hair when I’ve time to just show it the comb;</div>
    <div class="verse">I’ll owe ’em five pounds, and a blessing besides, as will only bring him safe and sound home.</div>
    <div class="verse">He’s blue eyes, and not to be call’d a squint, though a little cast he’s certainly got;</div>
    <div class="verse">And his nose is still a good un, tho’ the bridge is broke, by his falling on a pewter pint pot;</div>
    <div class="verse">He’s got the most elegant wide mouth in the world, and very large teeth for his age;</div>
    <div class="verse">And quite as fit as Mrs. Murdockson’s child to play Cupid on the Drury Lane Stage.</div>
    <div class="verse">And then he has got such dear winning ways&mdash;but oh I never never shall see him no more!</div>
    <div class="verse">O dear! to think of losing him just after nursing him back from death’s door!</div>
    <div class="verse">Only the very last month when the windfalls, hang ’em, was at twenty a penny!</div>
    <div class="verse">And the threepence he’d got by grottoing was spent in plums, and sixty for a child is too many.</div>
    <div class="verse">And the Cholera man came and whitewash’d us all and, drat him, made a seize of our hog.</div>
    <div class="verse">It’s no use to send the Crier to cry him about, he’s such a blunderin’ drunken old dog;</div>
    <div class="verse">The last time he was fetched to find a lost child, he was guzzling with his bell at the Crown,</div>
    <div class="verse">And went and cried a boy instead of a girl, for a distracted Mother and Father about Town.</div>
    <div class="verse">Billy&mdash;where are you, Billy, I say? come Billy, come home, to your best of Mothers!</div>
    <div class="verse">I’m scared when I think of them Cabroleys, they drive so, they’d run over their own Sisters and Brothers.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">Or may be he’s stole by some chimbly sweeping wretch, to stick fast in narrow flues and what not,</div>
    <div class="verse">And be poked up behind with a picked pointed pole, when the soot has ketch’d, and the chimbly’s red hot.</div>
    <div class="verse">Oh I’d give the whole wide world, if the world was mine, to clap my two longin’ eyes on his face.</div>
    <div class="verse">For he’s my darlin of darlins, and if he don’t soon come back, you’ll see me drop stone dead on the place.</div>
    <div class="verse">I only wish I’d got him safe in these two Motherly arms, and wouldn’t I hug him and kiss him!</div>
    <div class="verse">Lauk! I never knew what a precious he was&mdash;but a child don’t not feel like a child till you miss him.</div>
    <div class="verse">Why there he is! Punch and Judy hunting, the young wretch, it’s that Billy as sartin as sin!</div>
    <div class="verse">But let me get him home, with a good grip of his hair, and I’m blest if he shall have a whole bone in his skin!”</div>

<h3 id="THE_OBSERVER">THE OBSERVER.</h3>

<p>“I<span class="smaller">T</span>’<span class="smaller">S</span> very strange,” said the coachman,&mdash;looking at me over his left
shoulder&mdash;“I never see it afore&mdash;but I’ve made three observations
through life.”</p>

<p>Bat&mdash;so called for shortness, though in feet and inches he was rather
an Upper Benjamin&mdash;was anything but what Othello denominates “a puny
whipster.” He had brandished the whip for full thirty years, at an
average of as many miles a day; the product of which, calculated
according to Cocker, appears in a respectable sum total of six figures
deep.</p>

<p>Now an experience picked up in a progress of some three hundred
thousand miles is not to be slighted; so I leaned with my best ear over
the coachman’s shoulder, in order to catch every syllable.</p>

<p>“I have set on the box, man and boy,” said Bat, looking straight ahead
between his leaders, “a matter of full thirty year, and what’s more,
never missing a day&mdash;barring the Friday I was married; and one of my
remarks is&mdash;I never see a sailor in top-boots.”</p>

<p>“Now I think of it, Bat,” said I, a little disconcerted at my windfall
from the tree of knowledge, “I have had some experience in travelling
myself, and certainly do not recollect such a phenomenon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take my oath you haven’t,” said Bat, giving the near leader a
little switch of self-satisfaction. “I once driv the Phenomenon myself.
There’s no such thing in nature. And I’ll tell you another remarkable
remark I’ve made through life&mdash;I never yet see a Jew Pedlar with a
Newfoundland dog.”</p>

<p>“As for that, Bat,” said I, perhaps willing to retort upon him a
little of my own disappointment, “though I cannot call such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> a sight
to mind&mdash;I will not undertake to say I have never met with such an
association.”</p>

<p>“If you have, you’re a lucky man,” said Bat, somewhat sharply, and with
a smart cut on the wheeler; “I belong to an association too, and we’ve
none of us seen it. There’s a hundred members, and I’ve enquired of
every man of ’em, for it’s my remark. But some people see a deal more
than their fellows. Mayhap you’ve seen the other thing I’ve observed
through life, and that’s this&mdash;I’ve never observed a black man drive a
long stage.”</p>

<p>“Never, Bat,” said I, desiring to conciliate him, “never in the whole
course of my stage practice; and for many years of my life I was a
daily visitant to Richmond.”</p>

<p>“And no one else has ever seen it,” said Bat. “That’s a correct remark,
anyhow. As for Richmond, he never drove a team in his life, for I asked
him the question myself, just after his fight with Shelton.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_CONTRAST">THE CONTRAST.</h3>

<p>“I <span class="smaller">HOPE</span> the Leviathan is outward-bound,” I ejaculated, half aloud, as
I beheld the Kit-Kat portion of the Man-Mountain occupying the whole
frame of the coach-window. But Hope deceived as usual; and in he came.</p>

<p>I ought rather to have said he essayed to come in,&mdash;for it was only
after repeated experiments upon material substances, that he contrived
to enter the vehicle edgeways,&mdash;if such blunt bodies may be said to
have an edge at all. As I contemplated his bulk, I could not help
thinking of the mighty Lambert, and was ready to exclaim with Gratiano,
“A Daniel! a second Daniel!”</p>

<p>The Brobdignaggian had barely subsided in his seat, when the opposite
door opened, and in stepped a Liliputian! The conjunction was
whimsical. Yonder, thought I, is the Irish Giant, and the other is the
dwarf, Count Borulawski. This coach is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> their travelling caravan&mdash;and
as for myself, I am no doubt the showman.</p>

<p>I was amusing myself with this and kindred fancies, when a hand
suddenly held up something, at the coach window. “It’s my luggage,”
said the Giant, with a small penny-trumpet of a pipe, and taking
possession of a mere golden pippin of a bundle.</p>

<p>“The three large trunks and the biggest carpet-bag are <i>my</i> property,”
said the Dwarf, with a voice as unexpectedly stentorian.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

   <img class="mtop1" src="images/i_083.jpg"
      alt="" /></a>
  <p class="caption mbot1">THE GREAT MAIL CONTRACTOR.</p>
</div>

<p>“Warm day, Sir,” squeaked the Giant, by way of small talk.</p>

<p>“Prodigious preponderance of caloric in the atmosphere,” thundered the
Dwarf, by way of big talk.</p>

<p>“Have you paid your fare, gentlemen?” asked the coachman, looking in at
the door.</p>

<p>“I have paid half of mine,” said the Stupendous, “and it’s booked. My
name is Lightfoot.”</p>

<p>“Mine is Heavyside,” said the Pigmy, “and I have disbursed the sum
total.”</p>

<p>The door slammed&mdash;the whip cracked&mdash;sixteen horse-shoes made a clatter,
and away bowled the New Safety; but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> barely rolled two hundred
yards, when it gave an alarming bound over some loose paving stones,
followed by a very critical swing. The Dwarf, in a tone louder than
ever, gave vent to a prodigious oath; the Giant said, “Dear me!”</p>

<p>There will something come of this, said I to myself; so, feigning
I sleep, I leaned back in a corner, with a wary ear to their
conversation. The Gog had been that morning to the Exhibition of
Fleas, in Regent Street, and thought them “prodigious!” The Runtling
had visited the Great Whale at Charing-Cross, and “thought little of
it.” The Goliath spoke with wonder of the “vast extent of view from
the top of the Monument.” The David was “disappointed by the prospect
from Plinlimmon.” The Hurlothrumbo was “amazed by the grandeur of St.
Paul’s.” The Tom Thumb spoke slightingly of St. Peter’s at Rome. In
theatricals their taste held the same mathematical proportion. Gog
“must say he liked the Minors best.” The “Wee Thing” declared for the
Majors. The Man-Mountain’s favourite was Miss <i>Foote</i> = twelve inches.
The Manikin preferred Miss <i>Cubitt</i> = eighteen.</p>

<p>The conversation, and the contrast, flourished in full flower through
several stages, till we stopped to dine at the Salisbury Arms, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>The Folio took a chair at the ordinary&mdash;</p>

<p>The Duodecimo required “a room to himself.”</p>

<p>The Puppet bespoke a leg of mutton&mdash;</p>

<p>The Colossus ordered a mutton-chop.</p>

<p>The Imp rang the bell for “the loaf”&mdash;</p>

<p>The Monster called for a roll.</p>

<p>A magnum of port was decanted for the Minimum.</p>

<p>A short pint of sherry was set before the Maximum.</p>

<p>We heard the Mite bellowing by himself, “The Sea! the Sea! the open
Sea!”</p>

<p>The Mammoth hummed “The Streamlet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tiny, we learned, was bound to Plimpton Magna.</p>

<p>The Huge, we found, was going to Plimpton Parva.</p>

<p>A hundred other circumstances have escaped from Memory through the
holes that time has made in her sieve: but I remember distinctly, as we
passed the bar in our passage outwards, that while</p>

<p>The Pigmy bussed the landlady&mdash;a buxom widow, fat, fair, and forty&mdash;</p>

<p>The Giant kissed her daughter&mdash;a child ten years old, and remarkably
small for her age.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible for you, my dear Charles, to conceive the
difficulties and anarchical manifestations of turbulence, which
threaten and disturb your old birth-place, poor Stoke Pogis. To the
reflecting mind, the circumstances which hourly transpire afford ample
food for speculation and moral reasoning. To see the constituted
authorities of a place, however mistaken or misguided by erring
benevolence, plunging into a fearful struggle with an irritated,
infuriated, and I may say, armed populace, is a sight which opens a
field for terrified conjecture. I look around me with doubt, agitation,
and dismay; because, whilst I venerate those to whom the sway of a
part of a state may be said to be intrusted, I cannot but yield to
the conviction that the abuse of power must be felt to be an overstep
of authority in the best intentioned of the Magistracy. This even you
will allow. Being on the spot, my dear Charles, an eye-witness of
these fearful scenes, I feel how impossible it is for me to give you
any idea of the prospects which surround me. To say that I think all
will end well, is to trespass beyond the confines of hope; but whilst
I admit that there is strong ground for apprehending the worst, I
cannot shut my eyes to the conviction, that if firm measures, tempered
with concession, be resorted to, it is far from being out of the pale
of probability that serenity may be re-established. In hazarding this
conclusion, however, you must not consider me as at all forgetting
the responsibilities which attach to a decidedly formed opinion. Oh,
Charles! you who are in the quiet of London, can little dream of the
conflicting elements which form the storm of this devoted village. I
fear you will be wearied with all these details; but I thought at this
distance, at which you are from me, you would wish me to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> the risk
of wearying you rather than omit any of the interesting circumstances.
Let Edward read this; his heart, which I know beats for the Parish,
will bleed for us.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Nothing further has yet occurred, but you shall hear from me
again to-morrow.</p>

<p class="center mbot1 mtop1"><i>Another Account.</i></p>

<p>Symptoms of disunion have for some time past prevailed between the
authorities of Stoke Pogis, and a part of the inhabitants. The primum
mobile or first mobbing, originated in an order of the Mayor’s, that
all tavern doors should shut at eleven. Many complied, and shut,
but the door of the Rampant Lion openly resisted the order. A more
recent notice has produced a new and more dangerous irritation on our
too combustible population. A proclamation against Guy Fauxes and
Fireworks was understood to be in preparation, by command of the chief
Magistrate. If his Worship had listened to the earnest and prudential
advice of the rest of the bench, the obnoxious placard would not have
been issued till the 6th, but he had it posted up on the 4th, and by
his precipitation has plunged Stoke Pogis into a convulsion, that
nothing but Time’s soothing syrup can alleviate.</p>

<p class="center mbot1 mtop1"><i>From another quarter.</i></p>

<p>We are all here in the greatest alarm! a general rising of the
inhabitants took place this morning, and they have continued in a
disturbed state ever since. Everybody is in a bustle and indicating
some popular movement. Seditious cries are heard! the bell-man is going
his rounds, and on repeating “God save the King!” is saluted with
“Hang the crier!” Organised bands of boys are going about collecting
sticks, &amp;c., whether for barricades or bonfires is not known; many of
them singing the famous Gunpowder Hymn, “Pray remember,” &amp;c. These
are features that remind us of the most inflammable times. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
strangers of suspicious gentility arrived here last night, and
privately engaged a barn; they are now busily distributing hand-bills
amongst the crowd: surely some horrible tragedy is in preparation!</p>

<p class="center mbot1 mtop1"><i>A later account.</i></p>

<p>The alarm increases. Several families have taken flight by the waggon,
and the office of Mr. Stewart, the overseer, is besieged by persons
desirous of being passed to their own parish. He seems embarrassed
and irresolute, and returns evasive answers. The worst fears are
entertaining.</p>

<p class="center mbot1 mtop1"><i>Fresh Intelligence.</i></p>

<p>The cause of the overseer’s hesitation has transpired. The pass-cart
and horse have been lent to a tradesman, for a day’s pleasure, and
are not returned. Nothing can exceed the indignation of the paupers!
they are all pouring towards the poor-house headed by Timothy Gubbins,
a desperate drunken character, but the idol of the Workhouse. The
constables are retiring before this formidable body. The following
notice is said to be posted up at the Town-hall: “Stick No Bills.”</p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>Eleven o’clock.</i></p>

<p>The mob have proceeded to outrage&mdash;the poor poor-house has not a
whole pane of glass in its whole frame! The Magistrates, with Mr.
Higginbottom at their head, have agreed to call out the military; and
he has sent word that he will come as soon as he has put on his uniform.</p>

<p>A terrific column of little boys has just run down the High-street,
it is said to see a fight at the Green Dragon. There is an immense
crowd in the Market-Place. Some of the leading shopkeepers have had a
conference with the Mayor, and the people are now being informed by a
placard of the result. Gracious Heaven! how opposite is it to the hopes
of all moderate men&mdash;“The Mare is Hobstinate&mdash;He is at the Roes and
Crown&mdash;But refuses to treat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>Twelve o’clock.</i></p>

<p>The military has arrived, and is placed under his own command. He has
marched himself in a body to the market-place, and is now drawn up one
deep in front of the Pound. The mob are in possession of the walls, and
have chalked upon them the following proclamation; “Stokian Pogians be
firm! stick up for bonfires! stand to your squibs!”</p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>Quarter past Twelve.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Wigsby, the Master of the Free School, has declared on the side of
Liberty, and has obtained an audience of the Mayor. He is to return in
fifteen minutes for his Worship’s decision.</p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>Half past Twelve.</i></p>

<p>During the interval, the Mayor has sworn in two special constables, and
will concede nothing. When the excitement of the mob was represented to
him by Mr. Wigsby, he pointed to a truncheon on a table and answered,
“They may do their worsest.” The exasperation is awful&mdash;the most
frightful cries are uttered, “Huzza for Guys! Gubbins for ever! and
no Higginbottom!” The military has been ordered to clear the streets,
but his lock is not flinty enough, and his gun refuses to fire on the
people.</p>

<p class="center">* <span class="mleft3">* </span><span class="mleft3">*
</span><span class="mleft3">* </span><span class="mleft3">*
</span><span class="mleft3">*</span></p>

<p>The constables have just obtained a slight advantage; they made a
charge altogether, and almost upset a Guy. On the left-hand side of the
way they have been less successful; Mr. Huggins, the beadle, attempted
to take possession of an important street post, but was repulsed by a
boy with a cracker. At the same moment Mr. Blogg, the churchwarden, was
defeated in a desperate attempt to force a <i>passage</i> up a <i>court</i>.</p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>One o’clock.</i></p>

<p>The military always dines at one, and has retreated to the Pig and
Puncheon. There is a report that the head constable is taken with all
his staff.</p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>Two o’clock.</i></p>

<p>A flying watchman has just informed us that the police are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> victorious
on all points, and the same has been confirmed by a retreating
constable. He states that the Pound is full&mdash;Gubbins in the stocks, and
Dobbs in the cage. That the whole mob would have been routed, but for a
very corpulent man, who rallied them on running away.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">GOOD ENTERTAINMENT FOR MAN AND HORSE.</p>
</div>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1"><i>Half-past Three.</i></p>

<p>The check sustained by the mob proves to have been a reverse, the
constables are the sufferers. The cage is chopped to faggots, we
haven’t a pound, and the stocks are rapidly falling. Mr. Wigsby has
gone again to the Mayor with overtures, the people demand the release
of Dobbs and Gubbins, and the demolition of the stocks, the pound, and
the cage. As these are already destroyed, and Gubbins and Dobbs are at
large, it is confidently hoped by all moderate men, that his Worship
will accede to the terms.</p>

<p class="right mright1 mbot1 mtop1">Four o’clock.</p>

<p>The Mayor has rejected the terms. It is confidently affirmed that after
this decision, he secretly ordered a post-chaise, and has set off with
a pair of post horses as fast as they can gallop. A meeting of the
principal tradesmen has taken place, and the butcher, the baker, the
grocer, the cheesemonger, and the publican, have agreed to compose a
Provisional Government. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> mean time the mob are loud in their
joy,&mdash;they are letting off squibs and crackers, and rockets, and devils
in all directions, and quiet is completely restored.</p>

<p>We subjoin two documents,&mdash;one containing the articles drawn up by the
Provisional Government and Mr. Wigsby; the other, the genuine narrative
of a spectator.</p>

<p>The events of the last few hours, since I closed my minute narration,
are pregnant with fate; and no words that I can utter on paper will
give you an idea of their interest. Up to the hour at which I closed
my sheet, anxiety regulated the movement of every watchful bosom; but
since then, the approaches to tranquillity have met with barriers
and interruptions. To the meditative mind, these popular paroxysms
have their desolating deductions. Oh, my Charles, I myself am almost
sunk into an Agitator&mdash;so much do we take the colour from the dye in
which our reasoning faculties are steeped. I stop the press&mdash;yes,
Charles&mdash;I stop the press of circumstances to say, that a dawn of the
Pacific is gleaming over the Atlantic of our disturbances; and I am
enabled, by the kindness of Constable Adams, to send you a Copy of the

<p>I<span class="smaller">N</span> the autumn of 1825, some private affairs called me into the sister
kingdom; and as I did not travel, like Polyphemus, with my eye out,
I gathered a few samples of Irish character, amongst which was the
following incident.</p>

<p>I was standing one morning at the window of “mine Inn,” when my
attention was attracted by a scene that took place be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>neath. The
Belfast coach was standing at the door, and on the roof, in front, sat
a solitary outside passenger, a fine young fellow in the uniform of
the Connaught Rangers. Below, by the front wheel, stood an old woman,
seemingly his mother, a young man, and a younger woman, sister or
sweetheart; and they were all earnestly entreating the young soldier to
descend from his seat on the coach.</p>

<p>“Come down wid ye, Thady,”&mdash;the speaker was the old woman&mdash;“come down
now to your ould mother. Sure it’s flog ye they will, and strip the
flesh off the bones I give ye. Come down, Thady, darlin!”</p>

<p>“It’s honour, mother,” was the short reply of the soldier; and with
clenched hands and set teeth he took a stiffer posture on the coach.</p>

<p>“Thady, come down&mdash;come down, ye fool of the world&mdash;come along down wid
ye!” The tone of the present appeal was more impatient and peremptory
than the last; and the answer was more promptly and sternly pronounced:
“It’s honour, brother!” and the body of the speaker rose more rigidly
erect than ever on the roof.</p>

<p>“Oh Thady, come down; sure it’s me, your own Kathleen, that bids ye.
Come down, or ye’ll break the heart of me, Thady, jewel; come down
then!” The poor girl wrung her hands as she said it, and cast a look
upward, that had a visible effect on the muscles of the soldier’s
countenance. There was more tenderness in his tone, but it conveyed the
same resolution as before.</p>

<p>“It’s honour, honour bright, Kathleen!” and as if to defend himself
from another glance, he fixed his look steadfastly in front, while the
renewed entreaties burst from all the three in chorus, with the same
answer.</p>

<p>“Come down, Thady, honey!&mdash;Thady, ye fool, come down!&mdash;Oh Thady, come
down to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s honour, mother!&mdash;It’s honour, brother!&mdash;Honour bright, my own
Kathleen!”</p>

<p>Although the poor fellow was a private, this appeal was so public, that
I did not hesitate to go down and enquire into the particulars of the
distress. It appeared that he had been home, on Furlough, to visit his
family,&mdash;and having exceeded as he thought the term of his leave, he
was going to rejoin his regiment, and to undergo the penalty of his
neglect. I asked him when the Furlough expired.</p>

<p>“The First of March, your honour&mdash;bad luck to it of all the black days
in the world,&mdash;and here it is come sudden on me like a shot!”</p>

<p>“The first of March!&mdash;why, my good fellow, you have a day to spare
then,&mdash;the first of March will not be here till to-morrow. It is Leap
Year, and February has twenty-nine days.”</p>

<p>The soldier was thunderstruck.&mdash;“Twenty-nine days, is it&mdash;You’re sartin
of that same!&mdash;Oh, Mother, Mother!&mdash;the Divil fly away wid yere ould
Almanack&mdash;a base cratur of a book, to be deceaven one, afther living so
long in the family of us!”</p>

<p>His first impulse was to cut a caper on the roof of the coach, and
throw up his cap, with a loud Hurrah!&mdash;His second was to throw himself
into the arms of his Kathleen, and the third, was to wring my hand off
in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“It’s a happy man I am, your Honour, for my word’s saved, and all by
your Honour’s manes&mdash;Long life to your Honour for the same!&mdash;May ye
live a long hundred&mdash;and lape-years every one of them!”</p>

<p>I<span class="smaller">T</span> was on the 1st of Augst,&mdash;I remember by my wags cumming dew, and
I wanted to be riz,&mdash;that Me and master maid our minds up to the
Mounting. I find Master as oppend an acount with the Keep Sack&mdash;but as
that is a cut abov, and rit in by only Lords and Laddies, I am reduced
to a Peer in the pagis of the Comick Anual&mdash;Mr H giving leaves.</p>

<p>Wile we waited at Sham Money, our minds sevral tims misgiv, but
considdring only twelve Gentelmen and never a footmun had bin up,
we determind to make ourselves particler, and so highered gides to
sho us up. For a long tim the whether was dout full weather&mdash;first
it snew&mdash;then thew&mdash;and then friz&mdash;and that was most agreeabil for a
tempting. The first thing I did was to change my blew and wite livry,
as I guest we shood hav enuf of blew and wite on the mounting&mdash;but put
on a dred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> nort for fear of every thing&mdash;takin care to hav my pockets
well cramd with sand witches, and, as proved arterwards, they broke
my falls very much when I slipd on my bred and ams. The land Lord was
so kind as lend me His green gaws tap room blind for my eyes, and I
recumend no boddy to go up any Snowhill without green vales&mdash;for the
hice dazls like winkin. Sum of the gides wanted me to ware a sort of
crimpt skaits, but thoght my feet would be the stifer for a cramp
on&mdash;and declind binding any think xcept my list garters round my Shews.
I did all this by advize of John Maly Cuthay the Chief Gide, who had
bin 8 tims up to every think. Thus a tired we sit out, on our feat,
like Capting Paris, with our Nor poles in our hands,&mdash;Master in verry
good sperrits, and has for me I was quit ellivatted to think what a
figger the Summut of Mount Blank wood cut down the airys of Portland
Plaice.</p>

<p>Arter sliping and slidding for ours, we cum to the first principle
Glazier. To give a correct noshun, let any won suppose a man in
fustions with a fraim and glass and puttey and a dimond pensel, and its
quit the revers of that. It’s the sam with the Mare of Glass. If you
dont think of a mare or any think maid of glass you have it xactly. We
was three ours gitting over the Glazier, and then come to the Grand
Mullets, ware oar beds was bespoak&mdash;that is, nothing but clean sheats
of sno,&mdash;and never a warmin pan. To protect our heds we struck our
poles agin the rock, with a cloath over them, but it looked like a
verry little tent to so much mounting. There we was,&mdash;all Sno with us
Sollitory figgers atop. Nothink can give the sublime idear of it but a
twelf Cake.</p>

<p>The Gides pinted out from hear the Pick de Middy, but I was too cold to
understand Frentch&mdash;and we see a real Shammy leeping, as Master sed,
from scrag to scrag, and from pint to pint, for vittles and drink&mdash;but
to me it looked like jumpin a bout to warm him self. His springs in the
middel of Winter I realy beleave as uncredible. Nothink else was muving
xcept Have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>launches, witch is stupendus Sno balls in high situations,
as leaves their plaices without warnin, and makes a deal of mischief in
howses and famlies. We shot of our pistle, but has it maid little or no
noise, didnt ear the remarkbly fine ekko.</p>

<p>We dind at the Grand Mullets on cold foul and a shivver of am, with
a little O de Colon, agen stomical pans. Wat was moor cumfortble we
found haf a bottel of brandey, left behind by sum one before, and by
way of return we left behind a littel crewit of Chilly Viniger for the
next cummer, whoever he mite be or not. Alter this repass’d we went to
our sublime rests, I may say, in the Wurld’s garrits, up 150 pare of
stares. As faling out of Bed was dangerus, we riz a wal of stons on
each side. Knowing how comfortble Master sleeps at Home, I regretted
his unaccommodation, and partickly as he was verry restless, and every
tim he stird kickd me about the Hed. I laid awack a good wile thinking
how littel Farther, down in Summerset Sheer, thoght I was up in Mount
Blank Sheer; but at long and last I went of like a top, and dremt of
Summuts. Won may sleep on wus pillers than Nap Sacks.</p>

<p>Next mornin we riz erly, having still a good deal to git up, and
skrambled on agin, by crivises and crax as maid our flesh crawl on
hands and nees to look at. Master wanted to desend in a crack, but
as he mite not git up in a crack agin, his letting himself down was
unrecomended. Arter menny ours works, we cum to the Grand Plato. Master
called it a vast Amphi-Theater; and so it is, except Du-Crow and the
Horses and evry thing. Hear we brekfisted, but was surprizd at our
stomicks not having moor hedges, Master only eting a Chickin wing,
and me only eting all the rest. We had littel need to not eat,&mdash;the
most uneasy part to go was to cum. In about too ours we cum to a Sno
wall, up rite as high as St. Paul’s; that maid us cum to an alt, and
I cood not help saying out, Wat is only too human legs to 200 feet!
Howsumever, after a bottel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> Wine we was abel to proceed in a zig zag
direxion,&mdash;the Gides axing the way, and cutting steps afore. After a
deal of moor white slavery, we sucsided in gitting up to the Mounting’s
top, and no body can hav a distant idea of it, but them as is there.
Such Sno! And ice enuf to serve all the Fish Mungers, and the grate
Routs till the end of the Wurld!</p>

<p>I regrets my joy at cumming to the top maid me forget all I ment to do
at it; and in partickler to thro a tumble over hed and heals, as was
my mane object in going up. Howsumever, I shall allways be abel to say
Me and Master as bin to the Summut of Mount Blank, and so has a little
butterfly. I ought to mension the curiousness of seeing one there, but
we did not ketch it, as it was too far abov us.</p>

<p>We dissented down in much shorter time, and without anny axident xcept
Masters sliding telliscope, witch roled of the ice. Wen we cum agin to
Sham Money, the Land Lord askd our names to be rit in the book, as was
dun, by Mr. W. in prose, but by me in poetry&mdash;</p>

<p>I<span class="smaller">S</span> a double dealer, for he dealeth more in double meanings than your
punster. When he giveth his word it signifieth little, howbeit it
standeth for two significations. He putteth his promises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> like his
colts in a break. Over his mouth, Truth, like the turnpike man, writeth
up No Trust. Whenever he speaketh, his spoke hath more turns than the
fore-wheel. He telleth lies, not white only, or black, but likewise
gray, bay, chestnut-brown, cream, and roan&mdash;piebald and skewbald. He
sweareth as many oaths out of court as any man, and more in; for he
will swear two ways about a horse’s dam. If, by God’s grace, he be
something honest, it is only a dapple, for he can be fair and unfair
at once. He hath much imagination, for he selleth a complete set of
capital harness, of which there be no traces. He advertiseth a coach,
warranted on its first wheels, and truly the hind pair are wanting to
the bargain. A carriage that hath travelled twenty summers and winters,
he describeth well-seasoned. He knocketh down machine horses that
have been knocked up on the road, but is so tender of heart to his
animals that he parteth with none for a fault; “for,” as he sayeth,
“blindness or lameness be misfortunes.” A nag, proper only for dog’s
meat, he writeth down, but crieth up, “fit to go to any hounds;” or,
as may be, “would suit a timid gentleman.” String-halt he calleth
“grand action,” and kicking, “lifting the feet well up.” If a mare
have the farcical disease, he nameth her “out of Comedy,” and selleth
Blackbird for a racer because he hath a running thrush. Horses that
drink only water, he justly warranteth to be “temperate,” and if dead
lame, declareth them “good in all their paces,” seeing that they can
go but one. Roaring he calleth “sound,” and a steed that high bloweth
in running, he compareth to Eclipse, for he oustrippeth the wind.
Another might be entered at a steeplechase, for why&mdash;he is as fast as
a church. Thoroughpin with him is synonymous with “perfect leg.” If a
nag cougheth, ’tis “a clever hack.” If his knees be fractured, he is
“well broke for gig or saddle.” If he reareth, he is “above sixteen
hands high.” If he hath drawn a tierce in a cart he is a good fencer.
If he biteth, he shows good courage; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> is playful merely, though
he should play the devil. If he runneth away, he calleth him “off the
Gretna Road, and has been used to carry a lady.” If a cob stumbleth, he
considereth him a true goer, and addeth “The proprietor parteth from
him to go abroad.” Thus, without much profession of religion, yet is
he truly Christian-like in practice, for he dealeth not in detraction,
and would not disparage the character even of a brute. Like unto Love,
he is blind unto all blemishes, and seeth only a virtue, meanwhile he
gazeth at a vice. He taketh the kick of a nag’s hoof like a love token,
saying only, before standers-by, “Poor fellow,&mdash;he knoweth me!”&mdash;and
is content rather to pass as a bad rider, than that the horse should
he held restive or over-mettlesome which discharges him from its back.
If it hath bitten him beside, and moreover bruised his limb against a
coach-wheel, then, constantly returning good for evil, he giveth it but
the better character, and recommendeth it before all the studs in his
stable. In short, the worse a horse may be, the more he chanteth his
praise, like a crow that croweth over Old Ball, whose lot it is on a
common to meet with the Common Lot.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smaller">HOSE</span> who have peeped into the portfolios of Mr. Geoffrey Crayon,
will easily remember his graphic sketches of a locality called Little
Britain&mdash;and his amusing portraits of its two leading families,
the Lambs and the Trotters. I imagine the deserved popularity of
the draughtsman made him much in request at routs, soirées, and
conversazioni, or so acute an observer would not have failed to notice
a nocturnal characteristic of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> neighbourhood,&mdash;I mean the
frequent and alarming glares of light that illuminate its firmament;
but in spite of which, no parish engine rumbles down the steps of
St. Botolph, the fire-ladders hang undisturbed in their chains, and
the turn-cock smokes placidly in the tap-room of the Rose-and-Crown.
For this remarkable apathy, my own more domestic habits enable me to
account.</p>

<p>It is the fortune, or misfortune, of the house where I lodge to
confront that of Mr. Wix, “Wax and Tallow Chandler to his Majesty;” and
certainly no individual ever burned so much to evince his loyalty. He
and his windows are always framing an excuse for an illumination.</p>

<p>The kindling aptitude ascribed to Eupyrions, and Lucifers, and Chlorate
Matches, is nothing to his. Contrary to Hoyle’s rules for loo,&mdash;a
single court card is sufficient with him for “a blaze.” He knows and
keeps the birthdays of all royal personages, and shows by tallow
in tins how they wax in years. As sure as the Park guns go off in
the morning, he fires his six-pounders in the evening; as sure as a
newsman’s horn is sounded in the street, it blows the same spark into
a flame.&mdash;In some cases his inflammability was such, he has been known
to ignite, and exhibit fire, where he should have shed water. He was
once&mdash;it is still a local joke&mdash;within an ace of rejoicing at Marr’s
Murder.</p>

<p>During the long War he was really a nuisance, and what is worse, not
indictable. For one not unused to the melting mood, he was strangely
given to rejoicing. Other people were content to light up for the great
victories, but he commemorated the slightest skirmishes. In civil
events the same, whether favourable to Whig or Tory. Like the lover
of Bessy Bell, and Mary Gray, he divided his flame between them.&mdash;He
lighted when the administration of the Duke of Wellington came in, and
he lighted when it went out,&mdash;in short, it seemed, as with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> Roman
Catholics, that candle-burning was a part of his religion, and that he
had got his religion itself from an illuminated missal.</p>

<p>To aggravate this propensity, Mr. Sperm, the great oil merchant, lives
nearly opposite to Mr. Wix, and his principle and his interest coincide
exactly with those of his neighbour. Mr. Sperm possesses a very large
star,&mdash;and, like certain managers, he brings it forward as often as he
can. He is quite as lax in his political creed as the chandler, and
will light up on the lightest occasions,&mdash;for instance, let there be
but a peal of bells, and the Genius of the Ring directly invokes the
Genius of the Lamp. In short, Mr. Wix and Mr. Sperm both resemble the
same thing&mdash;a merchant-man getting rid of goods by means of lighters.</p>

<p>As the other inhabitants do not always choose to follow the example of
these two&mdash;I have known our illuminations to be very select&mdash;the great
oil and tallow establishments blazing all alone in their glory. On
other occasions&mdash;for instance, the rejoicings for that bill which Lord
L. calls a Bill of Panes and Penalties&mdash;I have seen our street assume
the motley appearance of a chessboard, alternately dark and bright&mdash;to
say nothing of Mrs. Frampton’s lodging-house, where every tenant was
of a different sentiment,&mdash;and the several floors afforded a striking
example of the Clare Obscure.</p>

<p>Among general illuminations, I remember none more so than the one on
the accession of his late Majesty&mdash;but what so universally brightened
the Great Britain might be expected to light the Little one. It was in
reality an unrivalled exhibition of its kind, and I propose therefore
to give some account of it, the situation of my apartment having
afforded unusual opportunities&mdash;for it is at the angle of a corner
house and thus while its easterly windows stare into those of the
Rumbold family, its northern ones squint aside into the sashes of that
elderly spinster Miss Winter.</p>

<p>It must have been an extreme fit of loyalty that put such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> thought
into the penurious mind of Miss W., but she resolved for once in her
life to illuminate. I could see her at a large dining-table&mdash;so called
by courtesy, for it never dined&mdash;reviewing a regiment of glass custard
cups, so called also by courtesy, for they never held custard&mdash;and
another division of tall jelly glasses, equally unknown to jellies.
I might have thought that she meant for once to give a very light
supper, had I not seen her fill them all with oil from a little tin
can, and afterwards she furnished them with a floating wick. They were
then ranged on the window-frame, alternately tall and short; and after
this costly preparation, which, by the heaving of her neckerchief, she
visibly sighed over, she folded her arms demurely before her, and, by
the light of her solitary rush taper, sat down to await the extravagant
call of “Light-up!”</p>

<p>The elder Miss Rumbold&mdash;the parents were out of town&mdash;was not idle
in the mean time. She packed all the little R.’s off to bed&mdash;(I did
not see them have any supper)&mdash;and then, having got rid of the family
branches, began on the tin ones. She had fixed her head quarters in
the drawing-room, from whence I saw Caroline and Henry detached, with
separate parcels of tins and candles, to do the same office for the
floors above and below. But no such luck! After a while, the street
door gently opened, and forth sneaked the two deserters, of course to
see better illuminations than their own. At the slam of the door behind
them Miss Rumbold comprehended the full calamity: first, she threw up
her arms, then her eyes, then clenched her teeth and then her hands;
going through all the pantomime for distress of mind&mdash;but she had no
time for grieving, and indeed but little for rejoicing. Mr. Wix’s was
beginning to glitter. Tearing up and down stairs like a lamplighter on
his ladder, she furnished all the blank windows, and then returned to
the drawing-room; and what was evidently her favourite fancy, she had
completed and hung up two festoons of artificial flowers; but alas!
her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> stock on hand fell short a whole foot of the third window&mdash;I am
afraid for want of the very bouquet in Caroline’s bonnet. Removing the
unfortunate garlands, she rushed out full speed, and the next moment I
saw her in the story above, rapidly unpapering her curls, and making
herself as fit as time allowed, to sit in state in the drawing-room, by
the light of twenty-seven long sixes.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS.</p>
</div>

<p>A violent uproar now recalled my attention to Number 29, where the mob
had begun to call out to Miss Winter for her Northern Lights. Miss W.
was at her post, and rushed with her rush to comply with the demand;
but a sudden twitter of nervousness aggravating her old palsy, she
could not persuade her wavering taper to alight on any one of the
cottons. There was a deal of coquetting indeed between wick and wick,
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> nothing like a mutual flame. In vain the thin lover-like candle
kept hovering over its intended, and shedding tears of grease at every
repulse; not a glimmer replied to its glance, till at last, weary of
love and light, it fairly leaped out of its tin socket, and drowned its
own twinkle in a tall jelly-glass. The patience of the mob, already
of a thin texture, was torn to rags by this conclusion; they saw that
if she would, Miss Winter never <i>could</i> illuminate: but as this was
an unwelcome truth, they broke it to her with a volley of stones that
destroyed her little Vauxhall in a moment, and in a twinkle left her
nothing to twinkle with!</p>

<p>Shocked at this catastrophe, I turned with some anxiety to Miss
Rumbold’s, but with admirable presence of mind she had lighted
every alternate candle in her windows, and was thus able to present
a respectable front at a short notice. The mob, however, made as
much uproar as at Miss Winter’s, though the noise was different in
character, and more resembled the boisterous merriment which attends
upon Punch. In fact Miss Rumbold had a Fantoccini over head she little
dreamt of. Awakened by the unusual light, the younger Rumbolds had
rushed from bed to the window, where, exhilarated by childish spirits
and the appearance of a gala, they had got up an extempore Juvenile
Ball, and were dancing with all their might in their little nightcaps
and nightgowns. In vain the unconscious Matilda pointed to her candles,
and added her own private pair from the table to the centre window; in
vain she wrung her hands, or squeezed them on her bosom: the more she
protested in dumb show, the more the mob shouted; and the more the mob
shouted, the wilder the imps jigged about. At last Matilda seemed to
take some hint; she vanished from the drawing-room like a Ghost, and
reappeared like a Fury in the nursery&mdash;a pair of large hands vigorously
flourished and flogged&mdash;the heels of the Corps de Ballet flew up higher
than their heads&mdash;the mob shouted louder than ever&mdash;and exeunt omnes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>This interlude being over, the rabble moved on to Mr. Wix’s, whose
every window, as usual, shone “like nine good deeds in a naughty
world,” and he obtained nine cheers for the display. Poor Mr. Sperm
was not so fortunate. He had been struggling manfully with a sharp
nor-wester to light up his star, but one obstinate limb persisted in
showing which way the wind blew. It was a point not to be gained,
and though far from red hot, it caused a hiss that reached even to
Number 14, and frightened all the Flowerdews. Number 14, as the Clown
expresses it in Twelfth Night, was “as lustrous as ebony.” In vain Mrs.
Flowerdew pleaded from one window, and Mr. Flowerdew harangued from
the other, while Flowerdew junior hammered and tugged at the space
between; the glaziers and their friends unglazed everything; and I hope
the worthy family, the next time they have a Crown and Anchor, will
remember to have them the right side uppermost. Green and yellow lamps
decline to hang upon hooks that are topsy-turvy, and the blue and red
are just as particular.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that during the past proceedings, my eyes had
frequently glanced towards Number 28. Its occupier, Mr. Brookbank, was
in some remote way connected with the royal household, and had openly
expressed his intention of surprising Little Britain. And in truth
Little Britain was surprised enough, when it beheld at Mr. Brookbank’s
nothing but a few sorry flambeaux: he talked to the mob, indeed, of
a transparency of Peace and Plenty, but as they could see no sign of
either, and they had plenty of stones, they again broke the peace. I am
sorry to say that in this instance the mob were wrong, for there <i>was</i>
a transparency, but as it was lighted from the outer side, Mr. B.’s
Peace and Plenty smiled on nobody but himself.</p>

<p>There was only one more disorder, and it occurred at the very house
that I help to inhabit. Not that we were dim by any means, for we had
been liberal customers to Mr. Sperm and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> Mr. Wix: the tallow of one
flared in all our panes, and the oil of the other fed a brilliant W. P.
Alas! it was these fiery initials, enigmatical as those at Belshazzar’s
banquet, that caused all our troubles. The million could make out the
meaning of the W, but the other letter, divided in conjecture among
them, was literally a split P. Curiosity increased to furiosity, and
what might have happened nobody only knows, if my landlady had not
proclaimed that her W had spent such a double allowance of lamps, that
her R had been obliged to retrench.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">IGNIS FATUUS.</p>
</div>

<p>To aid her oratory, the rabble were luckily attracted from our own
display by a splendour greater even than usual at Number 9. The
warehouseman of Mr. Wix&mdash;<i>like Master like Man</i>&mdash;had got up an
illumination of his own, by leaving a firebrand among the tallow, that
soon caused the breaking out of an insurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> in Grease, and where
candles had hitherto been lighted only by Retail, they were now ignited
by Wholesale; or as my landlady said,&mdash;“All the fat was in the fire!”</p>

<p>I ventured to ask her when all was over, what she thought of the
lighting-up, and she gave me her opinion in the following sentiment, in
the prayer of which I most heartily concur. “Illuminations,” she said,
“were very pretty things to look at, and no doubt new Kings ought to be
illuminated; but what with the toil, and what with the oil, and what
with the grease, and what with the mob, she hoped it would be long,
very long, before we had a new King again!”</p>

<p>T<span class="smaller">HE</span> time is not yet come&mdash;but come it will&mdash;when the masts of our Royal
Navy shall be unshipped, and huge unsightly chimneys be erected in
their place. The trident will be taken out of the hand of Neptune, and
replaced by the effigy of a red hot poker; the Union Jack will look
like a smoke-jack; and Lambtons, Russels, and Adairs, will be made
Admirals of the Black; the forecastle will be called the Newcastle,
and the cockpit will be termed the coal-pit; a man-of-war’s tender
will be nothing but a Shields’ collier: first lieutenants will have to
attend lectures on the steam-engine, and midshipmen must take lessons
as climbing boys in the art of sweeping flues. In short, the good old
tune of “Rule Britannia,” will give way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> “Polly put the Kettle on;”
while the Victory, the Majestic, and the Thunderer of Great Britain
will “paddle in the burn,” like the Harlequin, the Dart, and the Magnet
of Margate.</p>

<p>It will be well for our song writers to bear a wary eye to the Fleet,
if they would prosper as Marine Poets. Some sea Gurney may get a seat
at the Admiralty Board, and then farewell, a long farewell, to the old
ocean imagery; marine metaphor will require a new figure-head. Flowing
sheets, snowy wings, and the old comparison of a ship to a bird, will
become obsolete and out of date! Poetical topsails will be taken aback,
and all such things as reefs and double reefs will be shaken out of
song. For my own part, I cannot be sufficiently thankful that I have
not sought a Helicon of salt water; or canvassed the Nine Muses as a
writer for their Marine Library; or made Pegasus a sea-horse, when
sea-horses as well as land-horses are equally likely to be superseded
by steam. After such a consummation, when the sea service, like the
tea service, will depend chiefly on boiling water, it is very doubtful
whether the Fleet will be worthy of anything but plain prose. I have
tried to adapt some of our popular blue ballads to the boiler, and
Dibdin certainly does not steam quite so well as a potato. However, if
his Sea Songs are to be in immortal use, they will have to be revised
and corrected in future editions thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>I<span class="smaller">N</span> my M. S. days,&mdash;and like many bookish bachelors of the same
standing,&mdash;I was a member of a private literary society, with a name
whereof I only remember that it began in Greek and ended in English.
This re-union was framed on the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> plan of such institutions;
except that the gallantry of the founders had ruled that half the
members might be of the female sex, and accordingly amongst our
“intellectual legs,” we numbered a fair proportion of the hose that are
metaphorically blue. We assembled weekly at the house of some Fellow
that had a house, where an original essay was first read by the author,
and then submitted to discussion, much as a school-boy first spins his
top and then lays it down to be pegged at by the rest of the company.
The subjects, like Sir Roger de Coverley’s picture, generally left a
great deal to be said on both sides, nor were there wanting choppers,
not to say hackers of logic, to avail themselves of the circumstance;
and as we possessed, amongst others, a brace of Irish barristers, a
Quaker, a dissenter to everything, an author who spoke volumes, a
geologist who could find sermons in stones, and one old man eloquent,
surnamed for his discursiveness the rambler, we had usually what Bubb
Doddington has called “a multiplicity of talk.”</p>

<p>It is worthy of record, however, and especially as running counter
to the received opinion of the loquacity of the sex, that no female
member was ever known to deliver or attempt to deliver a sentence on
the subject in debate. Now and then, perchance, a short clearing cough
would flatter us that we were going to benefit by feminine taste and
delicacy of sentiment; but the expectation invariably fell to the
ground, and we might as well have expected an opinion to transpire from
the wax work of Mrs. Salmon or Madame Tussaud. I have since learned, it
is true, from one of the maturest of the she-fellows, that she did once
actually contemplate a few words to the matter in hand, but that at the
very first stitch she lost her needle, by which she meant her tongue,
and then in seeking for her needle she lost the thread of her ideas,
and so gave up the task, she said, as not being “woman’s work.”</p>

<p>It would seem therefore, that a set discourse in company is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> altogether
incompatible with the innate diffidence and shrinking timidity
of the sex. Milton, indeed, makes this silent modesty a peculiar
characteristic of perfect womanhood, as evinced in the demeanour of
“accomplished Eve.” To mark it the more strongly, he liberally endows
our general mother with fluency of speech in her colloquies with Adam,
so as even to “forget all time” in conversing with him; whereas in
the presence of a third party,&mdash;the Angel Visitor for instance, whom
she less bids than makes welcome to her dessert,&mdash;she seldom opens
her lips. Nor is this an overstrained picture: the same matronly, or
spinsterly reserve, having survived the Fall, and the confusion of
Babel, and the more womanly of her daughters, however good at what the
Scotch call “a two-handed crack,” in a corner or behind a curtain will
still evince a paradisiacal hesitation, amounting to an impediment, in
addressing the most limited audience. In fact up to a comparatively
recent period, the Miltonic theory was practically acknowledged and
acted upon, at the theatre, the female characters of the Drama being
always represented by proxies of men or boys.</p>

<p>Even in the present age, the début of an actress, having so many
“lengths” to deliver in public, is reckoned one of the severest ordeals
that womanly modesty can undergo. The celebrated Mrs. Siddons described
it as a “fiery trial,”&mdash;a “terrible moment,”&mdash;and any play-goer who has
witnessed the first appearance of a young lady on any stage will easily
give credit for its agonies. The late Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; once described to me
very vividly her sufferings on a like awful occasion:&mdash;“The voice that
would not come, and the tremor that would not go&mdash;the frame inclining
to sink, and the head determined to swim,&mdash;the distinct consciousness
of the presence of the body, with the indistinct impression of the
absence of the mind. Thank Heaven,” she concluded, “that I had not to
‘extort’ the people, as Mawworm calls it, out of my own head&mdash;that I
had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> not to furnish the speech, as well as the courage to utter it; for
I protest that I could not have put together a sentence of my own, for
the saving of my life!”</p>

<p>With such experience and impressions of the inaptitude of the sex for
popular orators, my profound amazement may be conceived when on lately
glancing over the columns of a morning journal, my eye was arrested by
the extraordinary heading of</p>

<p class="s5 center mtop1 mbot1">PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE
POOR LAWS.</p>

<p>In the first tumult of my agitation I pitched my Morning Herald, where
Parson Adams threw his Æschylus, namely, behind the fire; but the very
next instant, with a vague notion that it would <i>blow</i> up, I snatched
it out again. I am not certain,&mdash;being in weak health and spirits,
and more than commonly nervous,&mdash;that I did not cry murder!&mdash;My first
sensation, indeed, was a physical one, a complication of acuteness
of earache, with the numbness of lock-jaw:&mdash;and then came the moral
consciousness of some stunning domestic calamity, that seemed dilating
every instant from a family into a national visitation. In fact I
recollect nothing at all approaching the first bodily shock, except
once, on the explosion of some neighbouring powder-mills, when a few
highly condensed moments of intense silence were followed by the sudden
burst of an imaginary peal, from a bell assembly of all the steeples
in England; nor can I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> recall any experience equal to my mental horror
afterwards, unless a certain delirious dream of being run away with by
four gray mares, in the York mail!</p>

<p>It was a considerable time before I could muster resolution to peruse
the speeches, the tone of which my prophetic soul forestalled as
less resembling the notes of the feminine dulcimer, or piano, or
hurdy-gurdy, than those of the masculine brazen trumpet. And should
this seem a <i>harsh</i> anticipation, it must be remembered that I had been
prepared by no previous rehearsals for such a burst of female oratory.
If I had met with a paragraph hinting that certain females had been
observed in rough weather, mysteriously haunting the sea-beach, say of
Scarborough for instance, and gesticulating, as if on speaking terms
with the billows, my classical reminiscences might have recalled the
system by which Demosthenes braced himself against the murmurs and
roarings of a popular assembly&mdash;and I might have comprehended that the
hoarse waves were resorted to as oratorical <i>breakers-in</i>. But there
was no such warning; and consequently the report came upon me with
all the startling suddenness and crash of a sempstress’s splitting a
piece of stout calico. There was something astounding in the bare idea
of a female voice, so commonly requiring a high pressure to induce
it to sing in private circles, volunteering in public assembly to
spout! A maiden speech even in a man is apt to excite a maidenly fever
of nervousness; and many a rough and tough old sea-commander, who
would have returned a broadside without flinching, has been converted
physiognomically into an admiral of the blue, white, and red, and has
found a bung in his speaking-trumpet, on having to reply to a volley
of thanks. The very subject, so steeped in party spirit,&mdash;for alas! it
is undeniable that the woes and wants of the poor have become a party
question,&mdash;the very subject so steeped in party spirit, always a raw
unrectified article, and at the present time distilled particularly
above proof, seemed peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> unfit for womanly lips. In short I
concluded primâ facie, that a female who could come forward, without
a rehearsal all along shore, or practise on provincial boards, as a
public orator, and on political topics, must needs be what some old
writer calls “a mankind woman,”&mdash;and akin to the Hannah Snells and Mary
Ann Talbots, that have heretofore enlisted in our army and navy. How
far I was justified in these forebodings a few extracts will serve to
show.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mrs. Susan Fearnley having been voted into the chair, opened the
business of the meeting by exhorting the females present <i>to take
the question of a repeal of this bill into their own hands</i>, and
not to rely on the exertions of others, <i>least of all on the House
of Commons</i>, but at once to assert <i>the dignity and equality of the
sex</i>, and as the chief magistrate of the realm was now a female,
to approach her <i>respectfully</i>, and lay their grievances before
her; and, should their application be unsuccessful, she would then
call upon them to resist the enforcement of this cruel law, <i>even
unto the death</i>&mdash;(loud cheers). Mrs. Grasby said, the new Poor
Law was not concocted by men, but by fiends in the shape of men;
it had been hatched and bred in the bottomless pit&mdash;(cheers). She
could wish the authors of this law to be sent to St. Helena, where
Napoleon was sent to, and remain till their bodies were wet with
the dew of heaven, and their hair as long as eagles’ feathers.
She would oppose that law, and she called upon her sisters now
before her to follow her example&mdash;(tremendous cheering). Mrs.
Hanson alluded to the personal disfiguration of the hair cutting
off, which excited much disapprobation; this was followed by a
description of the grogram gowns of shoddy and paste in which
the inmates of the bastiles are attired.” The address said, “We
approach your Majesty, and pray that you will exercise your
prerogative, and remove from your councils those heartless men who
are attempting to place us under this horrible law. <i>We beg leave
to remind your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> Majesty that allegiance is due only when protection
is extended to the subject.</i></p>

<p class="right mright2"><span class="mright3">“Signed on behalf of
the Meeting,</span><br />
“S<span class="smaller">USAN</span> F<span class="smaller">EARNLEY</span>, <i>Chairwoman</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>And the report said, “Thanks were then voted with loud cheering to Earl
Stanhope, Mr. J. Fielden, to the Chairwoman, Mrs. Grasby, and Mrs.
Hanson, for their eloquent speeches, and to the other females, who had
got up and managed the meeting. Three groans were then given for the
Whigs, and all who support the Poor Law Bill.”</p>

<p>I have purposely omitted an astounding declaration of the wives and
mothers in the address, about their daughters, hoping that it is only
founded on local scandal; and now, if such another merry meeting may
be wished, what right-thinking Benedict or Bachelor but will join with
me and Dogberry in a “God prohibit it?” When the Steam Washing Company
was first established, there was a loud and shrill outcry against
what were facetiously called the Cock Laundresses, who were roundly
accused of a shameful invasion of woman’s provinces, and favoured
with many sneering recommendations to wear mob caps, and go in stuff
petticoats and pattens. But if Hercules with the distaff be but a sorry
spectacle, surely Omphale with the club cuts scarcely a better figure.
The he-creatures may now fairly retort, that it is as consistent
with manhood to go out washing, as for womanhood to do chairing at
a public meeting. If it be out of character for a fellow in a coat
and continuations to be firsting and seconding linen, it is equally
anomalous for a creature in petticoats to be firsting and seconding
political resolutions; and for my own part, as a matter of taste, I
would rather see a Gentlemen blowing up a copper flue than a Lady
blowing up the foulness of the Poor Law.</p>

<p>In the mean time, there is reason to apprehend that the infection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> is
gaining ground; the last post having brought me the following letter on
the subject from a country correspondent.</p>

<p class=" center mtop1"><i>To the Editor of Hood’s Own, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="mleft1">H<span class="smaller">ONOURED</span> S<span class="smaller">IR</span>,</p>

<p>I don’t know whether you be married or likely to be in the way of
courting, but whether or not, most likely you have a mother or sister,
or aunt, or she-cousin, or some such connexion of the female sex; as
such will be interested in the following, as a matter that concerns
us all, and particularly men like myself of a quiet turn and domestic
habits.</p>

<p>By station I am only a plain, family man in the farming line, but to my
misfortune, as turns out, I am locally situated in the county of York,
and what’s worse, a great deal too nigh Elland, and where the women
got up the spouting meeting again the Poor Laws that made such a noise
in the country. I’m not a political character myself, and as such have
nothing to object for or against public meetings and speechifyings,
so long as it’s confined to the male kind; but with as good nerves
as most men that can ride to hounds, nothing since incendiarism has
given them such a shook as the breaking out of female elocution, for
in course like the rick burnings and the influenzy, or any other new
kick, it will go through the whole country. My own house has catched
for one, and I will inform you the symptoms it begins with. The Elland
Meeting, you see, was on a Tuesday, and between you and me and the
post, it’s my belief that my mistress was present, though she do say,
it were a visit to her mother. Otherwise I cannot think what could put
her teeth into her head on the Wednesday for the first time, by which
I mean to say her spelling for a new set, if it was not to assist her
parts of speech. Agricultural distress has made gold much more scarce
among farmers than formerly, and I don’t mind saying it’s more than I
could afford comfortably at most times to lay out twenty guineas in
ivory for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> the sake of a correct pronouncing. However I made no remark,
except to myself, namely, that they wasn’t wanted to keep her tongue
between. For my own part I have always found she could speak plain
enough, and particularly when I couldn’t&mdash;by reason of dining at the
ordinary on market days and the like. Any way she always contrived to
speak her mind, but ever since the meeting she seems to have had more
mind to speak; for instance, a long confabbing with every beggar at the
gate, instead of sending off as formerly with nothing but a flea in
their ear, as the saying is. In short, many more things struck me as
suspicious, and amongst the rest, her making an errand again to Eland
for a piece of stuff and a little fustian&mdash;in pint of fact, that visit
seemed to set her more agog than before, so as to start a new notion of
going up to London about Betsy’s impediment, and says she, I can kill
two birds, and get my new teeth at the same time. If that don’t look
oratorical, thinks I to myself, then I don’t know what does. However,
last Sunday was a week lets the whole cat out of the bag, as the saying
is as near as may be as follow. It was just after dinner, and only our
two selves quite domestically, Betsy being gone to grandmother’s, and
me going to take my first glass of wine, and so as usual, I nodded to
my good woman, with a “Here’s to ye, Kate!” according to custom&mdash;when
lo! and behold, up jumps Madam regularly on her legs opening like a
hound that has just hit the scent, and begins a return thanks, and
delivery of sentiments and so forth, before I knew where I was. Where
she got the knack of it without practice, Lord knows, for it’s more
than ever I was competent to, as for instance, when I’ve been publicly
drunk at our Coursing Club, and the like. However she was five good
minutes long afore she broke down, or recollected herself, I don’t know
which, and I’m free to say, left me so dumbfounded in a mizmaze that I
hadn’t presence of mind to argue the point. However, before going to
bed, I thought best to open gently on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> the subject, but as might be
expected, the more we differed, the more we debated, which in course
was just what Madam wanted, till at long and at last, seeing that I
was only being practised upon, like Betsy’s piano, I thought proper to
adjourn myself off to roost, but from the nature of my dreams, have
reason to think she continued the argument in her sleep.</p>

<p>And now, honoured Sir, what is to be done to stop such a national
calamity as hangs over us like a thundercloud, unless it’s put down
by the powerful voice of the public press? Not wishing to connect
myself with politics, which all newspapers are more or less inclined
to, and your periodical being mentioned to me by our doctor as an
impartial vehicle, am induced to the liberty of this communication, to
be made use of at your discretion. My own sentiments are very strong
on the subject, but more than I can express by penmanship. We have a
saying here in the north about a crowing hen that seems quite pat to
the case. And if you keep live stock, what can cut a foolisher figure
than a great gawksome hen, leaving her eggs to addle in the neat, or
her chicks, if so be, to the care of the kite, to go a spurring and
sparring about the yard with her hackle up, and trying to crow like
a cock of the walk? So it is with the mistress of a house leaving
her helpless babes, or what is worse, her grown-up girls, to their
own cares and looking after, to go ranting and itineranting all over
the country, henpecking at the heads of the nation, and cackling up
on tables, or in waggons, or on the hustings. It’s my opinion nature
intended the whole sex to be more backward in coming forward, let alone
tattle at tea-drinkings, or gossiping at christenings, or laying-in,
but to be totally unaccustomed to public speaking. As to state affairs,
some do think there’s more talking than doing already, and in course
it will be no cure for it, to match the House of Lords with a House of
Ladies. In the mean time, I don’t mean to come down the money for the
new teeth or the impediment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> hoping that the speeches at Elland
may prove the last dying speeches of female elocution,</p>

<p>I <span class="smaller">KNOW</span> not what friend, or fiend, or both together, put such a folly
into the head of my maternal parent; but, like Hamlet’s mother, she set
her widow’s cap at the sex, and re-married. A second marriage is seldom
a favourable alteration of state; it is like changing a sovereign
twice over; first into silver, and then into copper. My mother’s step
was of this description! My first father was a plump, short, and
rather Dutch-built little person; but the most merry, good-humoured,
and kind-hearted, yet withal the slowest goer of the human race. His
successor was saturnine in spirit, and stern in temper, a tall bony
figure, remarkable for the length of his nether limbs; he was, to adopt
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> school-boy phrase, a Walker by name, and a walker by nature; and
the exercise of this propensity taught me painfully to appreciate the
difference between my dear first Daddy and my Daddy-Long-legs.</p>

<p>My father Heavy-sides was what is called slow and sure: which means
sure to be left behind. He had a solemn creak in his shoes, that
declared how deliberately his toes turned on their hinges; his movement
through life was a minuet de la cour. My Step-father Walker’s was a
galopade. Considered as Foot Soldiers, or adverse parties of infantry,
before one had well marched into his position, the other would have
turned his right flank, cut off his left wing, charged his centre,
harassed his rear, and surrounded his whole body. They were, alas!
literally the quick and the dead, causing between them a race of my
toes against my tears, and, if anything, my toes ran the fastest and
farthest.</p>

<p>There has been lately a good deal of speculation as to the ownership
of a certain poem; but I feel assured that my Step-father was the
practical author of the “Devil’s Walk.” The March of Mind might
possibly have kept up with him, but no March of body could do it; least
of all, such a body as mine, naturally heavy, and furnished with a pair
of lower limbs, very different from those of the son of Scriblerus,
who made his legs his compasses for measuring islands and continents.
Strain them as I would in pursuit of my Step-father, I seemed to
take nothing by my motion; those hopeless coat-flaps were always in
front; like Doctor Johnson’s great Shakspeare, with little Time at his
heels, I panted after him in vain. The pace, as the jockeys say, was
severe. It was literally a flight of steps, for he seemed to fly; if
any gentleman could be in two places at once, like a bird, that man
was my Step-father, or rather Fore-father, for he was always in front.
His stride was that of the Colossus of Rhodes; like Robinson Crusoe,
you could discern one foot-print in the sand, but the other was beyond
discovery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> My infatuated mother was nevertheless continually holding
him out to me as an example, and recommending me to “tread in his
steps!”&mdash;I wish I had been able! When his friends, or creditors, have
been informed at the door, that he “had just stept out,” how little did
they dream that it meant he was a mile off!</p>

<p>It was his pleasure, whenever my Step-father walked, that I should
accompany him; such accompaniment as flute adagio is sometimes heard
to give to piano prestissimo. He seemed to pride himself, like some
pompous people, in constantly having a poor foot-boy trotting it his
heels: often did I beg to be left at home; often, but vainly, address
him in the language of old Capulet’s domestic&mdash;“Good thou, save me a
piece of <i>march-pane</i>.” The descriptive phrase of “rocky fastnesses,”
was but too typical of his speed and temper; he had no more pity for
me, than the great striding Ogre, in the Seven-leagued Boots, for
little Hop-o’-my-Thumb.</p>

<p>The day of retribution at last came, for, according to the clown’s
doctrine, the whirligig of time always brings round its revenges. My
poor mother died, and had a walking funeral, and my Step-father felt
more for her than I had expected; but he suffered most in his legs and
feet: the measured pace of the procession afflicted him beyond measure;
he longed to give sorrow strides, but was forbidden; and he walked
and grieved like a fiery horse upon the fret. The slow pace seemed
as a slow poison: it has been affirmed that he caught cold upon the
occasion; but whether he did or not,&mdash;from that day he took ill, went
off rapidly, as he always did, in a galloping consumption, and died,
leaving me, as usual, behind him. In compliance with his last wish,
he was furnished with a walking funeral, and, as decency dictated, I
followed him to the grave; though in truth it was sacrificing the only
opportunity I ever had in the world, of getting before him.</p>

<p>I have been told that, the evening of his decease, his apparition
appeared to a first cousin at Penryn, and the same night to his brother
at Appleby. I have no particular faith in Ghosts, but this I do most
firmly believe, that if any Body had the Spirit to do the distance, in
the time, it was the very Spirit of my Step-father Walker.</p>

<p>I<span class="smaller">T</span> seems but the other day&mdash;instead of nearly ten years ago&mdash;that
my drawing-room door opened, and the female servant, with a very
peculiar expression of countenance, announced a memorable visitor.
Shakspeare has enquired “What is there in a name?” But most assuredly
he would have withdrawn the question could he have seen the effect of
a patronymic on our Sarah’s risible muscles. To render the phenomenon
more striking, she was a maiden little addicted to the merry mood: on
the contrary, she was rather more sedate than her age warranted. Her
face was of a cast decidedly serious&mdash;quiet brow&mdash;steady eyes&mdash;sober
nose&mdash;precise mouth, and solemn chin, which she doubled by drawing
it in demurely against her neck. The habitual expression of her
physiognomy was as grave, short of actual sadness, as human face could
assume, reminding you of those set, solid, composed, very decorous
visages, that indifferent persons put on for the day at a funeral: her
very complexion was uniformly colourless&mdash;pale yet not clear&mdash;that
<i>slack-baked</i> look which forbids the idea of levity. When she smiled,
which was rarely, and in cases where most females of her years would
have indulged in a titter, or excusable laugh, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> the faintest
possible approach to hilarity&mdash;the corners of her mouth curving, if
anything a little downwards. Nothing, in fact, less than galvanism,
which “sets corpses a-grinning,” seemed likely to shock her features
into any broad demonstration of jocularity, and yet, lo! there she was,
her face shortened by half its length&mdash;her mouth stretching from ear to
ear, and hardly able, for a suppressed giggle, to articulate its brief
announcement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <a id="i_166" name="i_166">
   <img class="mtop1" src="images/i_166.jpg"
      alt="" /></a>
  <p class="caption mbot1">PLEASE, SIR! HERE’S MR. GRIMALDI!!!!</p>
</div>

<p>I have always considered the above physiognomical miracle&mdash;the lighting
up of that seemingly impracticable countenance&mdash;as the best criticism I
have ever <i>seem</i> of the performances of the great Pan of Pantomime:&mdash;a
most eloquent retrospective review of the triumphs of his genius. It
was a glorious illustration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> the Pleasures of Memory, to behold
that face so like the stain a dead calm on a dull day burst suddenly
into ripples and radiance, like the brook that laughs in the sun. What
recollections of exquisite fooling must have rushed into her fancy
to convert that Quakerly maiden, as by a stage metamorphosis, into a
perfect figure of fun! What grotesque fantastic shapes must have come
tumbling, rolling, crawling, dangling, dancing, prancing, floundering,
flopping, striding, sliding, ambling, shambling, scrambling,
stumbling, bundling, and trundling into her mind’s eye, to so startle
her features from their propriety! What face-making faces, with
telegraphic brows&mdash;rolling, reeling, goggling, ogling, hard-winking,
and soft-blinking eyes&mdash;and grinning, gaping, pinching, puckering
mouths must have grimaced at her to put her steady countenance so out
of countenance! What is there in a name? Why magic! A serious, quiet,
decrepid man had but to announce himself, and Presto! Prestissimo!
before an engineer could cry “Ease her! stop her! back her!” our Sarah
had retraced her course up the stream of time to the bright wintry
gallery nights at the Lane, or the Garden, or the Midsummer Night’s
Dream at the Wells. Talk of magnetisers! when did Baron Dupotet, or any
of his sect, without pass or manipulation, thus throw a sedate, orderly
maiden, into an ecstasy, and set her looking through the back of her
head at the pantomimical experiences of the past? Talk of Laughing Gas!
when was there a facetious fluid so potent that the mere sight of the
empty bottle&mdash;(for such, alas! the ex-clown was become)&mdash;could throw
the ticklesome muscles into merry convulsions?</p>

<p>I have often speculated since on Sarah’s deportment, when, having
ushered “Mr. Grimaldi, alias Joe,” into the drawing-room, she returned
to her kitchen. Of course, in the first flutter and frisk of her animal
spirits, she postponed all domestic duties; or, at best, obliviously
broke the eggs into the flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> tub, popped the lump of butter into
the oven, and secured the rolling-pin in the safe. More probably she
dropped herself into the first chair that offered; and throwing her
apron over her head to shut out the daylight, indulged in a lamplight
vision of the drolleries of Mother Goose, or the Sleeping Beauty; when
the frolics of funny Joe had cheated her for awhile of the sorrows of
servitude, low wages, a crustaceous mistress, a <i>perfidus</i> young man,
and a hard place, with perhaps the bodily pains of a recent scald, a
bad bruise, and tight shoes. No doubt it had been one of her wishes,
born of wonder and curiosity, to see the popular Motley off the stage
“in his habit as he lived;” and lo! beyond her hope, she had met him
face to face without his paint, and been on speaking terms with that
marvellous voice, so sparingly heard, even on the stage.</p>

<p>For my own part, I confess to have been somewhat unsettled as well as
the bewildered maid by pantomimical associations. Slowly and seriously
as my visitor advanced, and with a decided stoop, I could not forget
that I had seen the same personage come in with two odd eyebrows, a
pair of right-and-left eyes, a wry nose, a crooked mouth, two wrong
arms, two left legs, and a free and easy body without a bone in it, or
apparently any centre of gravity. I was half prepared to hear that rare
voice break forth smart as the smack of a waggoner’s whip, or richly
stick and chuckling, like the utterance of a boy laughing, talking, and
eating custard, all at once, but a short interval sufficed to dispel
the pleasant illusion, and convinced me that the Grimaldi was a total
wreck.</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“Alas! how changed from him,</div>
    <div class="verse">The life of humour, and the soul of whim.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The lustre of his bright eye was gone&mdash;his eloquent face was passive
and looked thrown out of work&mdash;and his frame was bowed down by no
feigned decrepitude. His melancholy errand to me related to a Farewell
Address, which at the invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> of his staunch friend Miss Kelly&mdash;for
it did not require a request&mdash;I had undertaken to indite. He pleaded
earnestly that it might be brief, being, he said, “a bad study,” as
well as distrustful of his bodily strength. Of his sufferings he spoke
with a sad but resigned tone, expressed deep regret at quitting a
profession he delighted in, and partly attributed the sudden breaking
down of his health to the superior size of one particular stage,
which required of him a jump extra in getting off. That additional
bound, like the bittock at the end of a Scotch mile, had, he thought,
overtasked his strength. His whole deportment and conversation
impressed me with the opinion that he was a simple, sensible,
warm-hearted being, such indeed as he appears in his Memoirs&mdash;a Joseph
after Parson Adams’s own heart. We shook hands heartily, parted, and
I never saw him again. He was a rare practical humorist, and I never
look into Rabelais, with its huge-mouthed Gargantua and his enormous
appetite for “plenty of links, chitterlings, and puddings,” in their

<span class="s6">A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.</span></h2>

</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>“T<span class="smaller">HE</span> Devil choke thee with un!”&mdash;as Master Giles, the Yeoman, said
this, he banged down a hand in size and colour like a ham, on the
old-fashioned oak table;&mdash;“I do say the Devil choke thee with un!”</p>

<p>The Dame made no reply: she was choking with passion and a fowl’s
liver&mdash;the original cause of the dispute. A great deal has been said
and sung of the advantage of congenial tastes amongst married people,
but true it is, the variances of our Kentish couple arose from this
very coincidence in gusto. They were both fond of the little delicacy
in question, but the Dame had managed to secure the morsel for herself,
and this was sufficient to cause a storm of very high words&mdash;which
properly understood, signifies very low language. Their mealtimes
seldom passed over without some contention of the sort,&mdash;as sure as the
knives and forks clashed, so did they&mdash;being in fact equally greedy and
disagreedy&mdash;and when they did pick a quarrel&mdash;they picked it to the
bone.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="caption mbot1">BOXER AND PINCHER.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>It was reported, that on some occasions they had not even contented
themselves with hard speeches, but they had come to scuffling&mdash;he
taking to boxing, and she to pinching&mdash;though in a far less amicable
manner than is practised by the takers of snuff. On the present
difference, however, they were satisfied with “wishing each other dead
with all their hearts”&mdash;and there seemed little doubt of the sincerity
of the aspiration, on looking at their malignant faces,&mdash;for they made
a horrible picture in this frame of mind.</p>

<p>Now it happened that this quarrel took place on the morning of St.
Mark,&mdash;a Saint who was supposed on that Festival to favour his Votaries
with a peep into the Book of Fate. For it was the popular belief in
those days, that if a person should keep watch towards midnight, beside
the church, the apparitions of all those of the parish who were to be
taken by Death before the next anniversary, would be seen entering the
porch. The Yeoman, like his neighbours, believed most devoutly in this
superstition&mdash;and in the very moment that he breathed the unseemly
aspiration aforesaid, it occurred to him, that the Even was at hand,
when by observing the rite of St. Mark, he might know to a certainty
whether this unchristian wish was to be one of those that bear fruit.
Accordingly, a little before midnight he stole quietly out of the
house, and in something of a Sexton-like spirit set forth on his way to
the Church.</p>

<p>In the mean time the Dame called to mind the same ceremonial; and
having the like motive for curiosity with her husband, she also put on
her cloak and calash, and set out, though by a different path, on the
same errand.</p>

<p>The night of the Saint was as dark and chill as the mysteries he was
supposed to reveal, the moon throwing but a short occasional glance,
as the sluggish masses of cloud were driven slowly across her face.
Thus it fell out that our two adventurers were quite unconscious of
being in company, till a sudden glimpse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> moonlight showed them to
each other, only a few yards apart; both, through a natural panic, as
pale as Ghosts, and both making eagerly towards the church porch. Much
as they had just wished for this vision, they could not help quaking
and stopping on the spot, as if turned to a pair of tombstones, and in
this position the dark again threw a sudden curtain over them, and they
disappeared from each other.</p>

<p>It will be supposed the two came only to one conclusion, each
conceiving that St. Mark had marked the other to himself. With this
comfortable knowledge, the widow and widower elect hied home again
by the roads they came; and as their custom was to sit apart after a
quarrel, they repaired, each ignorant of the other’s excursion, to
separate chambers.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>By-and-by, being called to supper, instead of sulking as aforetime,
they came down together, each being secretly in the best humour, though
mutually suspected of the worst: and amongst other things on the table,
there was a calf’s sweetbread, being one of those very dainties that
had often set them together by the ears. The Dame looked and longed,
but she refrained from its appropriation, thinking within herself that
she could give up sweetbreads <i>for one year</i>: and the Farmer made a
similar reflection. After pushing the dish to and fro several times,
by a common impulse they divided the treat; and then having supped,
they retired amicably to rest, whereas until then, they had never gone
to bed without falling out. The truth was, each looked upon the other
as being already in the church-yard mould, or quite “moulded to their
wish.”</p>

<p>On the morrow, which happened to be the Dame’s birthday, the Farmer was
the first to wake, and <i>knowing what he knew</i>, and having besides but
just roused himself out of a dream strictly confirmatory of the late
vigil, he did not scruple to salute his wife, and wish her many happy
returns of the day. The wife, <i>who knew as much as he</i>, very readily
wished him the same, having in truth but just rubbed out of her eyes
the pattern of a widow’s bonnet that had been submitted to her in her
sleep. She took care, however, to give the fowl’s liver at dinner to
the doomed man, considering that when he was dead and gone, she could
have them, if she pleased, seven days in the week; and the Farmer, on
his part, took care to help her to many tid-bits. Their feeling towards
each other was that of an impatient host with regard to an unwelcome
guest, showing scarcely a bare civility while in expectation of his
stay, but overloading him with hospitality when made certain of his
departure.</p>

<p>In this manner they went on for some six months, and though without
any addition of love between them, and as much selfishness as ever,
yet living in a subservience to the comforts and inclinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> of each
other, sometimes not to be found even amongst couples of sincerer
affections. There were as many causes for quarrel as ever, but every
day it became less worth while to quarrel; so letting by-gones be
by-gones, they were indifferent to the present, and thought only of the
future, considering each other (to adopt a common phrase) “as <i>good</i> as
dead.”</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">“LET BY-GONES BE BY-GONES.”</p>
</div>

<p>Ten months wore away, and the Farmer’s birthday arrived in its turn.
The Dame, who had passed an uncomfortable night, having dreamt, in
truth, that she did not much like herself in mourning, saluted him as
soon as the day dawned, and with a sigh wished him many years to come.
The Farmer repaid her in kind, the sigh included; his own visions
having been of the painful sort for he had dreamt of having a headache
from wearing a black hatband, and the malady still clung to him when
awake. The whole morning was spent in silent meditation and melancholy
on both sides, and when dinner came, although the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> favourite
dishes were upon the table, they could not eat. The Farmer, resting his
elbows upon the board, with his face between his hands, gazed wistfully
on his wife,&mdash;scooping her eyes, as it were, out of their sockets,
stripping the flesh off her cheeks, and in fancy converting her whole
head into a mere Caput Mortuum. The Dame, leaning back in her high
arm-chair, regarded the Yeoman quite as ruefully,&mdash;by the same process
of imagination picking his sturdy bones, and bleaching his ruddy visage
to the complexion of a plaster cast. Their minds travelling in the
same direction, and at an equal rate, arrived together at the same
reflection; but the Farmer was the first to give it utterance:</p>

<p>“Thee’d be missed, Dame, if thee were to die!”</p>

<p>The Dame started. Although she had nothing but Death at that moment
before her eyes, she was far from dreaming of her own exit, and at
this rebound of her thoughts against herself, she felt as if an extra
cold coffin-plate had been suddenly nailed on her chest; recovering,
however, from the first shock, her thoughts flowed into their old
channel, and she retorted in the same spirit.&mdash;“I wish, Master, thee
may live so long as I!”</p>

<p>The Farmer, in his own mind, wished to live rather longer; for, at the
utmost, he considered that his wife’s bill of mortality had but two
months to run. The calculation made him sorrowful; during the last
few months she had consulted his appetite, bent to his humour, and
dove-tailed her own inclinations into his, in a manner that could never
be supplied; and he thought of her, if not in the language, at least in
the spirit of the Lady in Lalla Rookh&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“I never taught a bright Gazelle</div>
    <div class="verse">To watch me with its dark black eye,</div>
    <div class="verse">But when it came to know me well,</div>
    <div class="verse">And love me, it was sure to die!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>His wife, from being at first useful to him, had become agreeable,
and at last dear; and as he contemplated her approaching fate, he
could not help thinking out audibly, “that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> be a lonesome
man when she was gone.” The Dame, this time, heard the survivorship
foreboded without starting; but she marveled much at what she thought
the infatuation of a doomed man. So perfect was her faith in the
infallibility of St. Mark, that she had even seen the symptoms of
mortal disease, as palpable as plague spots, on the devoted Yeoman.
Giving his body up, therefore, for lost, a strong sense of duty
persuaded her, that it was imperative on her, as a Christian, to
warn the unsuspecting Farmer of his dissolution. Accordingly, with
a solemnity adapted to the subject, a tenderness of recent growth,
and a Memento Mori face, she broached the matter in the following
question&mdash;“Master, how bee’st?”</p>

<p>“As hearty, Dame, as a buck,”&mdash;the Dame shook her head,&mdash;“and I wish
thee the like,”&mdash;at which he shook his head himself.</p>

<p>A dead silence ensued: the Farmer was as unprepared as ever. There
is a great fancy for breaking the truth by dropping it gently,&mdash;an
experiment which has never answered any more than with Ironstone China.
The Dame felt this, and thinking it better to throw the news at her
husband at once, she told him in as many words, that he was a dead man.</p>

<p>It was now the Yeoman’s turn to be staggered. By a parallel course of
reasoning, he had just wrought himself up to a similar disclosure,
and the Dame’s death-warrant was just ready upon his tongue, when he
met with his own despatch, signed, sealed and delivered. Conscience
instantly pointed out the oracle from which she had derived the
omen, and he turned as pale as “the pale of society”&mdash;the colourless
complexion of late hours.</p>

<p>St. Martin had numbered his years; and the remainder days seemed
discounted by St. Thomas. Like a criminal cast to die, he doubted if
the die was cast, and appealed to his wife:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thee hast watched, Dame, at the church porch, then?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>“And thee didst see me spirituously?”</p>

<p>“In the brown wrap, with the boot hose. Thee were coming to the
church, by Fairthorn Gap; in the while I were coming by the Holly
Hedge”&mdash;For a minute the Farmer paused&mdash;but the next, he burst into a
fit of uncontrollable laughter; peal after peal&mdash;and each higher than
the last,&mdash;according to the hysterical gamut of the hyæna. The poor
woman had but one explanation for this phenomenon&mdash;she thought it a
delirium&mdash;a lightening before death, and was beginning to wring her
hands, and lament, when she was checked by the merry Yeoman:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dame, thee bee’st a fool. It was I myself thee seed at the church
porch. I seed thee too,&mdash;with a notice to quit upon thy face&mdash;but,
thanks to God, thee bee’st a-living, and that is more than I cared to
say of thee this day ten-month!”</p>

<p>The Dame made no answer. Her heart was too full to speak, but throwing
her arms round her husband, she showed that she shared in his
sentiment. And from that hour, by practising a careful abstinence from
offence, or a temperate sufferance of its appearance, they became the
most united couple in the county,&mdash;but it must be said, that their
comfort was not complete till they had seen each other, in safety, over
the perilous anniversary of St. Mark’s Eve.</p>

<p>I<span class="smaller">S</span> a sort of stranded marine animal, that the receding tide of life has
left high and dry on the shore. He pines for his element like a Sea
Bear, and misses his briny washings and wettings. What the ocean could
not do, the land does, for it makes him sick: he cannot digest properly
unless his body is rolled and tumbled about like a barrel-churn. Terra
firma is good enough he thinks to touch at for wood and water, but
nothing more. There is no wind, he swears, ashore&mdash;every day of his
life is a dead calm,&mdash;a thing above all others he detests&mdash;he would
like it better for an occasional earthquake. Walk he cannot, the ground
being so still and steady that he is puzzled to keep his legs; and ride
he will not, for he disdains a craft whose rudder is forward and not
astern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Inland scenery is his especial aversion. He despises a tree “before
the mast,” and would give all the singing birds of Creation for a
Boatswain’s whistle. He hates prospects, but enjoys retrospects.
An old boat, a stray anchor, or decayed mooring ring, will set him
dreaming for hours. He splices sea and land ideas together. He reads
of “shooting off a tie at Battersea,” and it reminds him of a ball
carrying away his own pigtail. “Canvassing for a situation,” recalls
running with all sails set for a station at Aboukir. He has the
advantage of our Economists as to the “Standard of Value,” knowing it
to be the British ensign. The announcement of “an arrival of foreign
vessels, with our ports open,” claps him into a Paradise of prize
money, with Poll of the <i>Pint</i>. He wonders sometimes at “petitions
to be discharged from the Fleet,” but sympathises with those in the
Marshalsea Court, as subject to a Sea Court Martial. Finally, try
him even in the learned languages, by asking him for the meaning of
“Georgius Rex,” and he will answer, without hesitation, “The wrecks of
the Royal George.”</p>

the last cry was a waterman’s, and went all through the vowels.</p>

<p>The Portsmouth Rocket pulled up, and a middle-aged, domestic-looking
woman, just handsome enough for a plain cook at an ordinary, was
deposited on the dicky; two trunks, three bandboxes, a bundle, and a
hand-basket, were stowed in the hind boot. “This is where I’m to go
to,” she said to the guard, putting into his hand a slip of paper. The
guard took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> paper, looked hard at it, right side upwards, then
upside down, and then he looked at the back; he in the mean time seemed
to examine the consistency of the fabric between his finger and thumb;
he approached it to his nose as if to smell out its meaning; I even
thought that he was going to try the sense of it by tasting, when by
a sudden jerk, he gave the label with its direction to the winds, and
snatching up his key-bugle began to play “Oh where, and oh where,” with
all his breath.</p>

<p>I defy the metaphysicians to explain by what vehicle I travelled to the
conclusion that the guard could not read, but I felt as morally sure
of it as if I had examined him in his a&mdash;b&mdash;ab. It was a prejudice not
very liberal; but yet it clung to me, and fancy persisted in sticking a
dunce’s cap on his head. Shakspeare says that “he who runs may read,”
and I had seen him run a good shilling’s worth after an umbrella that
dropped from the coach; it was a presumptuous opinion therefore to
form, but I formed it notwithstanding&mdash;that he was a perfect stranger
to all those booking-offices where the clerks are schoolmasters.
Morally speaking, I had no earthly right to clap an ideal Saracen’s
Head on his shoulders; but, for the life of me, I could not persuade
myself that he had more to do with literature than the Blue Boar.</p>

<p>Women are naturally communicative: after a little while the female
in the dicky brought up, as a military man would say, her reserve,
and entered into recitative with the guard during the pauses of the
key-bugle. She informed him in the course of conversation, or rather
dicky gossip, that she was an invaluable servant, and, as such,
had been bequeathed by a deceased master to the care of one of his
relatives at Putney, to exert her vigilance as a housekeeper, and
to overlook everything for fifty pounds a year. “Such places,” she
remarked, “is not to be found every day in the year.”</p>

<p>The last sentence was prophetic!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it’s Putney,” said the guard, “it’s the very place we’re going
through. Hold hard, Tom, the young woman wants to get down.” Tom
immediately pulled up; the young woman did get down, and her two
trunks, three bandboxes, her bundle, and her hand-basket, were
ranged round her. “I’ve had a very pleasant ride,” she said, giving
the fare with a smirk and a courtesy to the coachman, “and am very
much obliged,”&mdash;dropping a second courtesy to the guard,&mdash;“for other
civilities. The boxes and things is quite correct, and won’t give
further trouble, Mr. Guard, except to be as good as pint out the house
I’m going to.” The guard thus appealed to, for a moment stood all
aghast; but at last his wits came to his aid, and he gave the following
lesson in geography.</p>

<p>“You’re all right&mdash;ourn a’n’t a short stage, and can’t go round setting
people down at their own doors; but you’re safe enough at Putney&mdash;don’t
be alarmed, my dear&mdash;you can’t go out of it. It’s all Putney, from the
bridge we’ve just come over, to that windmill you almost can’t see
t’other side of the common.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Guard, I’ve never been in Putney before, and it seems a
scrambling sort of a place. If the coach can’t go round with me to the
house, can’t you stretch a pint and set me down in sight of it?”</p>

<p>“It’s impossible&mdash;that’s the sum total; this coach is timed to a
minute, and can’t do more for outsides if they was all kings of
England.”</p>

<p>“I see how it is,” said the female, bridling up, while the coachman,
out of patience, prepared to do quite the reverse; “some people are
very civil, while some people are setting beside ’em in dickies; but
give me the paper again, and I’ll find my own ways.”</p>

<p>“It’s chucked away,” said the guard as the coach got into motion; “but
just ask the first man you meet&mdash;anybody will tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I don’t know who or where to ask for,” screamed the lost woman
after the flying Rocket; “I can’t read; but it was all down in the
paper as is chucked away.”</p>

<p>A loud flourish of the bugle to the tune of “My Lodging is on the Cold
Ground” was the only reply: and as long as the road remained straight,
I could see “the Bewildered Maid” standing in the midst of her baggage,
as forlorn as Eve, when, according to Milton,</p>

<p>“I<span class="smaller">T</span>’<span class="smaller">S</span> a nasty evening,” said Mr. Dornton, the stockbroker, as he
settled himself in the last inside place of the last Fulham coach,
driven by our old friend Mat&mdash;an especial friend in need, be it
remembered, to the fair sex.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be outside,” said Mr. Jones, another stockbroker, “for a
trifle.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, as a speculation in options,” said Mr. Parsons, another
frequenter of the Alley.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Mat is waiting for,” said Mr. Tidwell, “for we are full
inside and out.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tidwell’s doubt was soon solved,&mdash;the coach-door opened and Mat
somewhat ostentatiously enquired, what indeed he very well knew&mdash;“I
believe every place is took up inside?”</p>

<p>“We’re all here,” answered Mr. Jones, on behalf of the usual complement
of old stagers.</p>

<p>“I told you so, Ma’am,” said Mat, to a female who stood beside him,
but still leaving the door open to an invitation from within. However,
nobody spoke&mdash;on the contrary, I felt Mr. Hindmarsh, my next neighbour,
dilating himself like the frog in the fable.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I shall do,” exclaimed the woman; “I’ve nowhere to
go to, and it’s raining cats and dogs!”</p>

<p>“You’d better not hang about, anyhow,” said Mat, “for you may ketch your
death,&mdash;and I’m the last coach,&mdash;aint I, Mr. Jones?”</p>

<p>“To be sure you are,” said Mr. Jones, rather impatiently; “shut the
door.”</p>

<p>“I told the lady the gentlemen couldn’t make room for her,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> answered
Mat, in a tone of apology,&mdash;“I’m very sorry, my dear” (turning towards
the female), “you should have <i>my</i> seat, if you could hold the
ribbons&mdash;but such a pretty one as you ought to have a coach of her own.”</p>

<p>He began slowly closing the door.</p>

<p>“Stop, Mat, stop!” cried Mr. Dornton, and the door quickly unclosed
again; “I can’t give up my place for I’m expected home to dinner; but
if the lady wouldn’t object to sit on my knees&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not the least in the world,” answered Mat, eagerly; “you won’t object,
will you, Ma’am, for once in a way, with a married gentleman, and a wet
night, and the last coach on the road?”</p>

<p>“If I thought I shouldn’t uncommode,” said the lady, precipitately
furling her wet umbrella, which she handed in to one gentleman, whilst
she favoured another with her muddy pattens. She then followed herself,
Mat shutting the door behind her, in such a manner as to help her in.
“I’m sure I’m obliged for the favour,” she said, looking round; “but
which gentleman was so kind?”</p>

<p>“It was I who had the pleasure of proposing, Madam,” said Mr. Dornton;
and before he pronounced the last word she was in his lap, with an
assurance that she would sit as lightsome as she could. Both parties
seemed very well pleased with the arrangement; but to judge according
to the rules of Lavater, the rest of the company were but ill at ease.
For my own part, I candidly confess I was equally out of humour with
myself and the person who had set me such an example of gallantry. I,
who had read the lays of the Troubadours&mdash;the awards of the old “Courts
of Love,”&mdash;the lives of the “preux Chevaliers”&mdash;the history of Sir
Charles Grandison&mdash;to be outdone in courtesy to the sex by a married
stockbroker! How I grudged him the honour she conferred upon him&mdash;how I
envied his feelings!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not stand alone, I suspect, in this unjustifiable jealousy.
Messrs. Jones, Hindmarsh, Tidwell, and Parsons, seemed equally
disinclined to forgive the chivalrous act which had, as true knights,
lowered all our crests and blotted our scutcheons, and cut off our
spurs. Many an unfair gibe was launched at the champion of the fair,
and when he attempted to enter into conversation with the lady, he
was interrupted by incessant questions of “What is stirring in the
Alley?”&mdash;“What is doing in Dutch?”&mdash;“How are the Rentes?”</p>

<p>To all these questions Mr. Dornton incontinently returned business-like
answers, according to the last Stock Exchange quotations; and he was in
the middle of an elaborate enumeration, that so and so was very firm,
and so and so very low, and this rather brisk, and that getting up,
and operations, and fluctuations, and so forth, when somebody enquired
about Spanish Bonds.</p>

<p>“They are looking up, <i>my dear</i>,” answered Mr. Dornton, somewhat
abstractedly; and before the other stockbrokers had done tittering the
stage stopped. A bell was rung, and whilst Mat stood beside the open
coach-door, a staid female in a calash and clogs, with a lantern in her
hand, came clattering pompously down a front garden.</p>

<p>“Is Susan Pegge come?” enquired a shrill voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I be,” replied the lady who had been dry nursed from town;&mdash;“are
you, Ma’am, number ten, Grove Place?”</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Dornton’s,” said the dignified woman in the hood advancing
her lantern,&mdash;“and&mdash;mercy on us! you’re in master’s lap!”</p>

<p>A shout of laughter from five of the inside passengers corroborated the
assertion, and like a literal cat out of the bag, the ci-devant lady,
forgetting her umbrella and her pattens, bolted out of the coach, and
with feline celerity rushed up the garden, and down the area, of number
ten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Renounce the woman!” said Dr. Dornton, as he scuttled out of the
stage&mdash;“Why the devil didn’t she tell me she was the new cook?”</p>

<p>“I<span class="smaller">NSIDE</span> or out, Ma’am?” asked the coachman, as he stood civilly with
the door in his hand.</p>

<p>“If you please, I’ll try <i>in</i> first,” answered the woman, poking in
an umbrella before her, and then a pair of pattens&mdash;“I’m not used to
coaching, and don’t think I could keep myself on the top.”</p>

<p>In she came, and after some floundering, having first tried two
gentlemen’s laps, she found herself in the centre of the front seat,
where she composed herself, with something of the air of a Catherine
Hayes, getting into a sledge for a trip to Tyburn. Except for her
fear, which literally made a fright of her, I should have called her
a pretty-looking woman,&mdash;but the faces she pulled were horrible. As
the cad enclosed her luggage in the hind-boot with a smart slam,
her features underwent an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> actual spasm; and I heard her whisper to
herself, “somethink broke.” As she spoke thus, she started on her feet,
and the horses doing the same thing at the same moment, the timid
female found herself suddenly hugging the strange gentleman opposite,
for which she excused herself by saying, “she wasn’t accustomed to be
so carried away.”</p>

<p>Down she plumped again in her old place, but her physiognomy didn’t
improve. She seemed in torture, as if broken, not upon one wheel, but
upon four. Her eyes rolled, her eyebrows worked up and down, as if
trying to pump out tears that wouldn’t come,&mdash;her lips kept going like
a rabbit’s, though she had nothing to eat, and I fancied I could hear
her grinding her teeth. Her hands, meanwhile, convulsively grasped
a bundle on her lap, till something like orange-juice squeezed out
between her fingers. When the coach went on one side, she clutched
the arm of whichever of her neighbours sat highest, and at a <i>pinch</i>
she laid hold of both. At last she suddenly turned pale, and somewhat
hastily I suggested that she perhaps did not prefer to ride backwards.</p>

<p>“If it’s all the same to <i>you</i>, Sir, I should really be glad to change
seats.”</p>

<p>The removal was effected, not without some difficulty, for she
contrived to tread on all our feet, and hang on all our necks, before
she could subside. It was managed, however, and there we sat again,
vis-a-vis, if such a phrase may be used where one visage was opposed to
visages innumerable; for if her face was her fortune, she screwed as
much out of it as she could. She hardly needed to speak, but she did so
after a short interval.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll excuse, but I can’t ride forrards neither.”</p>

<p>“The air’s what you wan’t Ma’am,” said a stout gentleman in the corner.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that <i>would</i> revive me,” said the female, with what the
musicians call a veiled voice, through her handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the lady out!” squealed a little man, who sat on her left,
whilst a stout gentleman on her right, after looking in vain for a
check-string, gave a pull at the corner of the skirt of a great-coat
that hung over the window, almost pulling the owner off the roof. The
Chronometer stopped.</p>

<p>“It’s the lady,” said the little man to the coachman, as the latter
appeared at the door; “she wants to be inside out.”</p>

<p>“It’s as the gentleman says,” added the female; “I an’t quite myself,
but I don’t want to affect the fare. You shan’t be any loser, for I’ll
discharge in full.”</p>

<p>“There’s the whole dicky to yourself, Ma’am,” said the coachman, with
something like a wink, and after some scuffling and scrambling, we felt
her seating herself on the “backgammon board” as if she never meant to
be taken up.</p>

<p>“It seems ungallant,” said the little man, as we got into motion again;
“but I think women oughtn’t to travel, particularly in what are called
short stages, for they’re certain to make them long ones. First of all,
they have been told to make sure of the right coach, and they spell it
all over, from ‘Horne and Co.’ and ‘licensed to carry,’ to No. nine
thousand, fourteen hundred and nine. Then they never believe the cads.
If one cries ‘Hackney,’ they say ‘that means Camberwell, and I’ve had
enough of getting into wrong stages.’ Then they have to ascertain it’s
the first coach, and when it will start exactly, and when they’re
sure of both points, they’re to be hunted for in a pastry-cook’s
shop, and out of that into a fruiterer’s. At last you think you have
’em&mdash;but no such thing. All the luggage is to be put in under their
own eyes&mdash;there’s a wrangle, of course, about that,&mdash;and when they’re
all ready, with one foot on the step, they’ve been told to make their
bargain with the coachman before they get in.”</p>

<p>“My own mother to a T,” exclaimed the fat man; “she agreed with a
fly-man, at Brighton, to convey her to the Devil’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> Dyke for twelve
shillings; but when it came to setting off, she couldn’t resist the
spirit of haggling. Says she, ‘What’ll you take me to the Devil for,
without the Dyke?’”</p>

<p>A loud scream interrupted any further illustration of female
travelling, and again the Chronometer stopped, losing at the rate of
ten miles in the hour. We all had a shrewd guess at the cause, but
the little man nevertheless thought proper to pop his little head out
of the window, and enquire with a big voice “What the plague we were
stopping for?”</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>lady</i> agin, Sir,” said the coachman, in a dissatisfied tone.
“She says the dicky shakes so, she’s sure it will come off: but it’s
all right now&mdash;I’ve got her in front.”</p>

<p>“It’s very well,” said the little man, “but if I travel with a woman
again in a stage&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Poo! poo!&mdash;consider your own wife,” said the stout man; “women can’t
be stuck in garden-pots and tied to sticks; they must come up to London
now and then. She’ll be very comfortable in front.”</p>

<p>“I wish she may,” said the little man, rather tartly, “but it’s hard to
suit the sex;”&mdash;and, as if to confirm the sentence, the coach, after
proceeding about a mile, came again to a full stop.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, gentlemen,” said the coachman, with a touch of his
hat, as be looked in at the window, “but she won’t do in front!”</p>

<p>“Just like ’em!” muttered the little man, “the devil himself can’t
please a woman.”</p>

<p>“I should think,” suggested the stout man, “if you were to give her the
box seat, with your arm well round her waist.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve tried that,” said the coachman, shaking his head; “it did
pretty well over the level, but we’re coming on a hill, and she can’t
face it.”</p>

<p>“Set her down at once, bag and baggage,” said the little man; “I’ve an
appointment at one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>“And for my part,” said a gentleman in black, “if there’s any delay, I
give you legal notice I shall hire a chaise at the expense of the coach
proprietors.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, curse her,” said the perplexed coachman, deliberately
taking off his hat, that he might have a scratch at his head; “she’s
had her pick, outside and in, back and front, and it’s no use of course
to propose to her to sit astride on the pole.”</p>

<p>“Oh Eve! Eve! Eve!” exclaimed the little man, who seemed to owe the sex
some peculiar grudge.</p>

<p>The man in black looked at his watch.</p>

<p>The coachman pulled out a handful of silver, and began to count out a
portion, preparatory to offering to return the woman her fare if she
would get down&mdash;when a cheering voice hailed him from above.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Tom&mdash;jump up&mdash;the lady’s creeping into the boot.”</p>

<p>“She won’t like that, I guess,” muttered Tom to himself, but in a
second the money jingled back into his pocket, and he was on his box
in the twinkling of an eye. Away went the coach over the brow of the
hill, and began to spin down the descent with an impetus increasing at
every yard. The wheels rattled&mdash;the chains jingled&mdash;the horse-shoes
clattered&mdash;and the maid in the boot shrieked like a maid in Bedlam.</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” ejaculated the stout gentleman.</p>

<p>The little man grinned&mdash;villanously like an ape.</p>

<p>The man in black pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her screams increased in volume, and ascended in
pitch&mdash;interrupted only by an occasional “oh Lord!” and equivalent
ejaculations. It was piteous to hear her; but there was no help for it.
To stop the coach was impossible; it had pressed upon the horses till,
in spite of all the coachman’s exertions, they broke into a gallop, and
it required his utmost efforts to keep them together. An attempt to
pull up would have upset us, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> sure as fate; luckily for us all Tom
did not make the experiment, and the Chronometer, after running down
one hill and half way up another, was stopped without accident.</p>

<p>“How’s the lady?” asked the stout man, anxiously thrusting his head and
shoulders out at one window, whilst I acted the same part at the other;
and, as the sufferer got down on my side of the coach, my curiosity was
first gratified. Never was figure more forlorn: her face was as pale as
ashes, and her hair hung about it in all directions through heat and
fright&mdash;her eyes as crazy as her hair, and her mouth wide open.</p>

<p>“How’s the lady?” repeated the stout gentleman.</p>

<p>As for her straw bonnet, it was like Milton’s Death, of no particular
shape at all, flat where it should have been full, square where it
ought to have been round, turned up instead of down, and down instead
of up&mdash;it had as many corners and nubbles about it as a crusty loaf.
Her shawl or scarf had twisted round and round her like a snake, and
her pelisse showed as ruffled and rumpled and all awry as if she had
just rolled down Greenwich Hill.</p>

<p>“How’s the lady? I say,” bellowed the big man.</p>

<p>One of her shoes had preferred to remain with the boot, and as the road
was muddy, she stood like a Numidian crane, posturing and balancing on
one leg; whilst Tom, hunting after the missing article, which declined
to turn up till everything else had been taken out of “the leathern
conveniency,” and as it was one of the old-fashioned boots it held
plenty of luggage.</p>

<p>“How is the lady?” was shouted again with no better success.</p>

<p>It was evident she had not escaped with the fright merely; her hands
wandered from her ribs to the small of her back, and then she rubbed
each knee. It was some time before she could fetch her breath freely,
but at last she mustered enough for a short exclamation.</p>

<p>“Oh them trunks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>“How’s the lady?” shouted the fat man for the last time; for finding
that it obtained no answer, he opened the door and bolted out, just
in time to have the gratification of putting on the woman’s one shoe,
whilst she clung with both her arms round his short neck.</p>

<p>“There, my dear,” he said with a finishing slap on the sole. “Bless my
heart, though, it’s a distressing situation! Coachman, how far is she
from London?”</p>

<p>“A good nine mile,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Gracious Heaven!” exclaimed the stout man. “She can’t <i>do</i> it!”</p>

<p>“It’s only nine mile,” said the woman, with a sort of hysterical
giggle;&mdash;“and I’m fond of walking.”</p>

<p>“Give her her luggage, then, at once,” cried the little man from the
coach. The dark man held out his watch. A passenger on the top swore
horribly, and threatened to get down, and Tom himself, as well as his
horses, were on the fret.</p>

<p>“There is no remedy,” sighed the fat man, as he resumed his old seat in
the corner of the coach. The whip smacked&mdash;I leaned out for a parting
look.</p>

<p>There she stood nursing three bundles, each as big as a baby, and as we
rolled off I heard her last words in this soliloquy:</p>

<p>“How <i>ham</i> I to <i>hever</i> to get to York by the mail?”</p>

<p>M<span class="smaller">Y</span> friend Walker is a great story-teller. He reminds me of the
professional tale-bearers in the East, who, without being particularly
requested by the company, begin reciting the adventures of Sinbad, or
the life, death, and resurrection of Little Hunchback. No sooner does
conversation flag for a few minutes, than W. strikes up, with some such
prelude as, “I told you about the Flying Fish affair before,&mdash;but as
you wish me to refresh your memory, you shall have it again.” He then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
deliberately fills his glass, and furnishes himself with a cork, a bit
of orange-peel, or an apple-paring, to be shredded and sub-shredded
during the course of narration. Many Scotchmen, by-the-way, and most
Canadians, are given to the same manual propensity. A lady located
towards the Back Settlements informed me, that at a party she gave, the
mantelshelf, chairs, tables, and every wooden article of furniture, was
nicked and notched by the knives of her guests, like the tallies of
our Exchequer. It is most probably an Indian peculiarity, and derived
by intercourse or intermixture with the Chipaways&mdash;but to return to W.
The other day, after dinner, with a select few of my friends, there
occurred one of those sudden silences, those verbal armistices, or
suspensions of words, which frequently provoke at irresistible allusion
to a Quaker’s meeting. Of this pause W. of course availed himself.</p>

<p>“You were going, Sir,” addressing the gentleman opposite, “to ask me
about the Pop business,&mdash;but I ought first to tell you how I came to be
carrying ginger-beer in my pocket.”</p>

<p>The gentleman thus appealed to, a straightforward old drysalter, who
had never seen W. in his life before, naturally stared at such a bold
anticipation of his thoughts; but before he could find words to reply,
W. had helped himself to a dozen almonds, which he began mincing, while
he set off at a steady pace in his story.</p>

<p>“The way I came to have ginger-beer in my pocket, was this. I don’t
know whether you are acquainted with Hopkins, Sir, of the Queen’s
Arms in the Poultry,” the drysalter shook his head; “it’s the house
I frequent, and a very civil obliging sort of fellow he is&mdash;that is
to say, was, two summers ago. The season was very sultry, and says I,
Hopkins, I wonder you don’t keep ginger pop&mdash;it’s a pleasant refreshing
beverage at this season, and particularly wholesome. Well, Hopkins
was very thankful for the hint, for he likes to have everything that
can be called for, and he was for sending off an order at once to the
ginger-beer manufactory, but I persuaded him better. None of their
wholesale trash, said I, but make your own. I’ll give you a recipe for
it&mdash;the best ever bottled. But I couldn’t gain my point. Hopkins hum’d
and haw’d, and thought nobody could make it but the makers. There was
no setting him right, so at last I determined to put him to the proof.
I’ll tell you what, Hopkins, said I, you don’t like the trouble, or I’d
soon convince you that a man who isn’t a maker can make it as well as
anyone&mdash;perhaps better. You shall have a sample of mine&mdash;I’ve got a few
bottles at my counting-house, and it’s only a step. Of course, Hopkins
was very much obliged, and off I went. In confidence between you and
me, Sir,&mdash;though I never had the pleasure of seeing you before&mdash;I
wanted to introduce ginger-beer at the Queen’s Arms as a public
benefit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure, Sir&mdash;I’m very much obliged,” stammered the drysalter, at a
loss what to say. “Ginger-beer, I’ve no doubt, is very efficacious, and
particularly after fruit or lobsters, for I observe you always see them
at the same shops.”</p>

<p>“The best drink in the dog-days all to nothing,” returned W., “but
ought to be amazingly well corked and wired down&mdash;and I’ll tell you
why&mdash;it will get vapid and maybe worse. Well, I’d got it in my coat
pocket, and was walking back, just by Bow Church, no more thinking of
green silk pelisses than you are, Sir, at this moment&mdash;upon my honour
I wasn’t&mdash;when something gave a pop and a splash, and I heard a female
scream. I was afraid to look round and when I did, you might have
knocked me down with a straw. You know, Tom (addressing me,) I’m not
made of brass,&mdash;for the minute I felt more like melted lead&mdash;heavy and
hot. Two full kettles seemed poured over me&mdash;one warm within, and the
other cold without. You never saw such an object! There she stood,
winking and gasping, and all over froth and foam, like a lady just
emerged out of the sea only they don’t bathe in green silk pelisses
and satin bonnets. You might have knocked me down with a hair. What I
did or said at first I don’t know; I only remember that I attempted to
wipe her face with my handkerchief, but she preferred her own. To make
things worse, the passengers made a ring round us, as if we had been
going to fight about it, and a good many of ’em set up a laugh. I would
rather have been surrounded by banditti. I don’t tell a lie if I say I
would gladly have been tossed out of the circle by a mad bull. How I
longed to jump like a Harlequin into a twopenny post-box, or to slip
down a plug like an eel!”</p>

<p>“Very distressing, indeed,” said the drysalter.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” resumed W., “I felt as much when my poor mother
died&mdash;I don’t, upon my soul! <i>She</i> was expected for years, but the
lady in green came like a thunderbolt!&mdash;When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> saw the ginger-beer
weltering down her, I would almost as soon have seen blood. I felt
little short of a murderer. How I got her into Tweedie’s shop, Heaven
knows! I suppose I pulled her in, for I cannot remember one word of
persuasion. However, I got her into Tweedie’s, and had just sense
enough to seat her in a chair, and to beg for a few dry cloths. To do
the dear creature justice, she bore it all angelically,&mdash;but every
smile, every syllable making light of her calamity, went to my heart.
You don’t know my original old friend, Charles Mathews, do you, Sir?”</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">BANDITTI SEIZING BOOTY.</p>
</div>

<p>The drysalter signified dissent.</p>

<p>“No matter&mdash;his theory is right all over&mdash;it is as true as gospel!”
exclaimed W., with an asseverating thump upon the table. “There <i>is</i>
an infernal, malicious, aggravating little de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>mon, hovers up aloft
about us, wherever we go, ready to magnify any mischief, and deepen
every disaster. Sure I am he hovered about me! The cloths came&mdash;but
as soon as I began to wipe briskly, bang again went ‘t’other bottle,’
and uncorked itself before it was called for. I shall never forget the
sound! Pop, whiz, fiz, whish&mdash;ish&mdash;slish&mdash;slosh&mdash;slush&mdash;guggle, guggle,
guggle: I’d rather have been at the exploding of the Dartford Powder
Mills! At the first report I turned hastily round, but by so doing,
I only diverted the <i>jet</i> from the open cases on the counter, to the
show-trays in the shop window, filled with Tweedie’s choicest cutlery;
and as I completed the pirouette, I favoured Tweedie himself with the
tail of the spout!”</p>

<p>“Very unpleasant, indeed,” said the drysalter, with a hard wink, as if
the fussy fluid had flown in his own face.</p>

<p>“Unpleasant!” ejaculated W., “it was unendurable! I could have cut my
throat with one of the wet razors&mdash;I could have stabbed myself with a
pair of the splashed scissors! The mess was frightful&mdash;bright steel
buckles, buttons, clasps, rings, all cut and polished&mdash;I saw Tweedie
himself shake his head as he looked at the chains and some of the
delicate articles. It wasn’t a time to stand upon words, and I believe
I cursed and swore like a trooper. I know I stamped about, for I went
on the lady’s foot, and that made me worse than ever. Tweedie says I
raved; and I do remember I cursed myself for talking of ginger-beer,
as well as Hopkins for not keeping it in his house. At last I got
so rampant, that even the lady began to console me, and as she had
a particularly sweet voice and manner, and Tweedie too, trying to
make things comfortable, I began to hear reason: but if ever I carry
ginger-beer again in my pocket, along Cheapside&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Till you’re a widower,” said I.</p>

<p>“I was coming to that, Sir,” continued W., still addressing the
drysalter. “I insisted on putting the lady into a coach, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> by that
means obtained her address, and as common politeness dictated, I
afterwards called and was well received. A new green silk dress was
graciously accepted, and a white one afterwards met with the same kind
indulgence, when the lady condescended to be Mrs. Walker. Our fortunes,
Sir, in this world, hinge frequently on trifles. Through an explosion
of pop I thus popped into a partner with a pretty fortune; but for all
that, I would not have any man, like the Persian in Hajji Baba, mistake
a mere accident for the custom of the country. For Cœlebs in Search of
a Wife to walk up and down Cheapside with a bottle of ginger-beer in
his pocket, would be Quixotic in the extreme.”</p>

<p>A<span class="smaller">MONGST</span> the many important topics which at present excite a popular
interest, must be reckoned the great question whether the West Indian
apprentices ought or ought not to be considered ought of their time?
A subject presenting such very strong lights and shadows, necessarily
produces a powerful and Rembrandt-like effect on the public mind;
nevertheless, it is only lately and accidentally, that I have been
induced to look critically into the colouring and handling of the
picture. It is not my wont to walk wilfully on Debatable Ground; but in
the present instance, I was seduced involuntarily into the dangerous
confines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> of “all we love and all we hate,” the borderland, where party
contends with party.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I was giving an order to a tradesman in the
Strand&mdash;<i>not far from Warren’s</i>&mdash;when, to the utter surprise and
disconcertment of the master of the shop, a poor African stepped in
from the street, and, with an obsequious bow, made an offer of his
sable services for a term of years.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

   <img class="mtop1" src="images/i_217.jpg"

  <p class="caption mbot1">“MASSA, YOU WANT A ’PRENTICE?”</p>
</div>

<p>It would require a far better artist than myself to do justice to the
scene which ensued on so unusual an application. The late Elia, in his
Essay on “Imperfect Sympathies,” has alluded to the natural repugnance
of the pale faces to the dark ones. “In the negro countenance,” he
says, “you will often meet with strong traits of benignity. I have
felt yearnings of tenderness towards some of these faces, or rather
masks, that have looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> out kindly upon one in casual encounters in
the streets and highways. I love what Fuller beautifully calls ‘these
images of God cut in ebony.’ But I should not like to associate with
them&mdash;to share my meals and my good-nights with them&mdash;because they are
black.” Such a feeling is truly an imperfect sympathy, but my Strand
shopkeeper evidently went beyond the essayist, and regarded “the
nigger” with a positive antipathy. “A good horse,” says the proverb,
“cannot be of a bad colour,” but I could not help feeling that a good
man might be of an unfortunate complexion, howbeit, of a hue which
wears well, washes well, does not fly, and, moreover, hides the dirt.
So far from being able to endure a moor as his companion, the master
tradesman could not look upon him as fit to be his subordinate. The
mere possibility of such a connexion had never occurred to him, or
assuredly, to the advertisement in the window for an apprentice, he
would have added “a White will be preferred,” or “No African need
apply.” In the meantime, it was sufficiently obvious that, even if
indentured, a Hottentot would never be “treated as one of the family.”
Whilst the master stared an unequivocal rejection, his wife looked
over his shoulder at the applicant, with all the <i>physical</i> expression
in her countenance, of the anticipation of a black dose; the little
boy took fright and tried to bolt; the baby even set its infantine
face against the adoption, and the very dog barked and growled at the
intruder as at a breed that was vermin. The result of such a scrutiny
needs hardly to be told; the poor candidate was unanimously blackballed
to his face, and recommended, unceremoniously, to make himself as
scarce as a swan of the same complexion.</p>

<p>It will do me no credit, I fear, with our active Abolitionists, to
confess, that the above little incident set me seriously thinking, for
the first time, on the condition of the Negro Apprentices. In addition
to my dread of becoming a <i>sidesman</i>&mdash;and there is a spirit abroad
which can convert even a black suit into a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>-coloured one&mdash;I
am too apt to take matters upon trust, and to suppose that the name
stands for the thing. Thus, in my simple belief, the outward-bound and
the homeward-bound apprentices, conformed to the same or nearly the
same articles; and if I thought at all of the sable ones, it was as
walking abroad on Sundays, drest in all their best, only with Phœbe
or Miss Diana, instead of “Sally in our Alley.” A common sense of
the eternal principles of justice helped, beside, to mislead me; for
who, with a drachm of philosophy, or a scruple of Christianity, could
suppose, that whilst the accidents of colour are overlooked in a good
horse, the moral qualities of a human being were weighed down by such
skin-deep casualties as occur every day in a baker’s oven? The scene
in the Strand, however, aroused certain misgivings; and for the mere
repose of my mind, it became necessary to procure further information,
in order to come to a settled opinion on the subject. To this end, it
was desirable to obtain the sentiments of a Black Apprentice, or at
least of a Black, and of an Apprentice, and fortune favoured me in the
search. Having delivered my instructions to the tradesman, it occurred
to me to pay an overdue visit to a decayed kinswoman in the same
neighbourhood, and in whose family affairs I took a friendly interest.
She happened to be at home; and after a preliminary conversation on the
weather, and Mr. Murphy, and the current news of the day, the discourse
turned on her son Richard, whom she had recently articled to an
architect; she had doubts, she said, of his being exactly comfortable
in his situation, but it was no fault of hers, as he had been placed in
it at his own urgent instances, in proof whereof she handed to me the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p0 mleft1">M<span class="smaller">Y</span> D<span class="smaller">EAR</span> M<span class="smaller">OTHER</span>,</p>

<p><span class="mleft1">This</span> is to say I am in good health and quite comfortable, and as
happy as can be expected away from home. I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> being an architect
very much. All the work I have had to do for the last fortnight,
has been to copy a drawing of a gate for a Porter’s Lodge, and to
look over portfolios of nice prints. My master is very kind, and
lets me fill up my time at over-hours how I like. I always dine
with him and Mrs. G., and have plenty to eat of whatever I prefer.
Last Sunday we had leg of lamb and asparagus, and a pigeon pie,
and a tart, besides a glass of wine afterwards. I’m allowed to sit
up to supper because I said I liked music, for Mr. G. plays on the
flute, and Mrs. G. sings to the piano. He is a very good man, and
she is a very motherly good woman; and the other night, because it
was so cold, I had a tumbler of hot elder wine. For the present I
sleep in the best spare bed till my own is got ready for me&mdash;and
when company comes I’m not sent off to it, but played last night
with the visitors till twelve o’clock, and they won all my pocket
money. I do hope and pray you won’t forget to send me some more, as
there’s another party next week. Altogether, I could not be better
off for food, or amusement, or any thing, so that I needn’t be any
longer on liking, as I like it very much, and am agreeable to be
bound as soon as you and master think proper; and I do hope you
won’t stick about the premium, as you seemed to think it a great
deal&mdash;but consider the treatment. Give my kind love to everybody,
and accept the same yourself, from, dear mother, your dutiful and
affectionate son,</p>

<p class="right mright1">R<span class="smaller">ICHARD</span> R<span class="smaller">UGGLES</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. G. desire their best compliments&mdash;they are

what I said about the premium, as I could never be so happy

<p>It may be supposed that I did not read the above effusion throughout,
without a smile on my countenance; but the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> gravely shook her
head, and said she had now to submit to me a very different statement,
whereupon with a sigh, and a reflection on the duplicity of the world
in general, and of architects in particular, she placed in my hands,
Protocol No. 2.</p>

<p><span class="mleft1">I</span> am very sorry to trouble your mind with anything unpleasant,
but a great change has taken place since the articles were signed
and the premium paid down. All the being on liking has come to
a sudden end. Mr. and Mrs. G. have thrown off their masks, and
he is a cruel tyrant; and instead of being another mother to me,
she is quite the reverse. I little thought the moment I became an
apprentice I should be a complete slave, and work like a horse.
Nothing but drawing, drawing, drawing, as long as it’s light&mdash;and
next week we begin lamps. I’ve no over-hours at all except in bed,
and that’s up in the back garret, and nothing but an old flock as
hard as wood. My being a parlour boarder is all over; and as to
sitting up to music and supper, I can’t repeat, but I’m d&mdash;d up at
night that I may be down in the morning. They have not sent me as
yet to take my meals in the kitchen, but I would almost as soon,
for I’m snubb’d if I open my lips at table; and the moment the
wine comes on I’m expected to be off, and am reminded if I don’t.
As for the visitors, they take no more notice of me than they do
of the foot-boy; but what goes most to my heart is, Mr. and Mrs.
G. never ask now after your delicate health. It’s very ungrateful
after paying so handsomely, but it’s my belief he doesn’t know
anything about architecture, and only takes in young gentlemen for
the sake of their premiums. I can t help feeling very unhappy, when
I think I’ve got to run seven years to come, and do wish you would
ask Uncle William, as he’s a lawyer, whether I can’t be turned
over by legal law, or cancelled and left to my liberty. Next to
an architect, I should like, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> was unbound, to be an author,
and write books; which I hope you will approve of, as it doesn’t
require any premium. But perhaps you would like to have me at home,
and to be nothing at all, with which I remain,</p>

<p>As the above letters are genuine, it is probable that many of my
readers, who are parents or guardians, have received similar epistles
from their sons or wards before or after their being articled to a
trade or a profession; at least there is reason to believe that the
above case is one of ordinary occurrence. Taking it, therefore, as a
fair sample of the practice in England, I was anxious to compare it
with the course of a negro apprenticeship in the colonies; and with
this view my next visit was paid to my old friend Colonel C., who had
recently arrived from Jamaica with a black “turn-over” in his service.
Having described the scene at the shop in the Strand, and explained my
errand, which, of course, subjected me to some raillery, my request was
acceded to, and Sambo was ordered to attend me to a private conference
in the study. He was a stout good-humoured African, with rather more
than the twilight intelligence allowed to the race by the late Monk
Lewis; but with all the characteristic relish for a talk with Massa,
ascribed to his brethren by the same pleasant authority. He entered
therefore into the discussion with the greatest good-will; and the
following, divested of his outlandish jargon, is the substance of his
evidence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>To my first question, whether he had ever betrayed any original
inclination to go into the rice, sugar, and tobacco line, he gave
a decided negative. He had no occasion, he said, to labour for a
livelihood, having been in his own country an independent black
prince, and heir-apparent, as I understood him, to the king of the
Eboes. He acknowledged, however, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> could neither read nor
write, and consequently had never applied personally, or by letter,
post paid, to any Transatlantic A. B. C. or X. Y. Z., in answer to
an advertisement for an “Articled Pupil.” He was taken, he affirmed,
at unawares, and he was positive that no premium was required with
him. It appeared, however, that he had been regularly bound, but on
explanation it turned out that it had been done with rope-yarn, and the
only indentures he knew of, were on his wrists and ankles, from the
pressure of his fetters. He had a decided impression that his parents
or guardians were never applied to for their concurrence; indeed he had
no recollection of being asked for his own assent to the arrangement.
He would “take his dam” he was never carried before the Chamberlain
or any official personage invested with similar functions, and denied
ever having received the slightest hint that the binding him was
necessary to entitle him to take up his freedom. In short, contrary
to the experience of Richard Ruggles, his very first step appeared to
have been into slavery, and it was only after a long term of severe
service in the rice-field and the cane-piece that he was constituted
an apprentice. This being the point to which the public interest is
mainly directed, my enquiries here became naturally more minute, and
the evidence was proportionably circumstantial. Taking the Ruggles
letters for my guide, I was at great pains to make out something
analogous to the state of being what is called “upon liking,” but I
failed to elicit anything of the sort; and from the solemnity, not to
say awfulness, of Sambo’s asseverations, there appeared no reason to
suspect his veracity. He denied most positively and repeatedly his
dining, in any one solitary instance, with his master and mistress,
and by consequence the pleasure of taking wine with them after the
social repast. He was equally firm in disclaiming any invitation to
sit up to supper; and instead of being asked if he liked music, he
declared indignantly that his favourite instruments the kitty-katty and
the ganby had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> been continually broken over his own head. He totally
repudiated the notion of playing at Pope Joan with the company that
came to his master’s house; and insisted that the only notice he ever
obtained from the visitors was his being “larrupped” by every gentleman
that got drunk, and none of them ever went away sober. On the whole he
would not allow himself to have received any personal benefit from his
metamorphosis by Act of Parliament into an apprentice; no, not even
to the extent of sparing him one single cut of the cowhide. He rather
thought, on the contrary, that the prospect of his being out of his
time in so many years had operated to the prejudice of the negro, by
tempting the owner in the interim to get as much out of him, and pitch
as much into him, as possible. To conclude, I charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> Sambo very home
with a question which has been much dwelt upon by certain members of
both Houses; namely, whether the blacks were “properly prepared” to
enter into a state of liberty? to which he answered very candidly,
that he had not formally examined them on the subject, but judging by
himself he should say they were quite as fit and prepared for freedom
as they had been for slavery, to which they had mostly been introduced
at an unfashionably short notice. For his own part he had been rather
suddenly emancipated by simply stepping on English ground; but the only
effect had been to inspire him with profound feelings of veneration and
gratitude towards the soil, and a most fervent wish that he could send
over a barrowful of the same earth for Black Juno and de pickaninnies
to put him foot upon in Jamakey.</p>

<p>Such was the result of my conference with Sambo; and it served to
account for the conduct of the tradesman in the Strand, by proving,
that instead of being treated as one of the family, in a limited sense,
the Negro is hardly looked upon as a member of that great domestic
circle which has a circumference of 360 degrees. It appears from the
facts, that an apprenticeship in Jamaica or Barbadoes has little or
nothing in common except the name, with an apprenticeship on our own
side of the Atlantic;&mdash;that under the same title there exists two
diametrically opposite systems, literally as different as light and
dark; and of course, as the hand said of the pair of gloves, “They
cannot <i>both</i> be right.” As the collective wisdom of the country has
decided that the Black style of <i>binding</i> is the correct pattern,
and that the Negroes are properly “done up,” it necessarily follows,
that our home-made articles are very loosely stitched, and without
a due provision for rough usage and durability. Assuming the sable
race to be subject to only a wholesome severity, it results that our
London Prentices and their kind, are held by indentures shamefully
lax in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> conditions, and are allowed a most culpable latitude
and indulgence. To place this gross partiality in the strongest light
and shade, let the servitude of the born Blacks be compared with that
of those “Africans of our own growth,” as Elia calls them, who derive
their nigritude not from nature but from soot. Simply because they
have once been whites, and are still white, or nearly white, once a
year, like the hawthorns in May, they are protected and even pampered
by laws, the framers of which have assuredly considered their own
crows as the fairest. Let any one turn to the Statute Anno Quarto et
Quinto Gulielmi IV. Regis, cap. 35, intituled “An Act for the Better
Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices,” and he will find
that the Climbing Boy, compared with the African, is almost a spoiled
child. Instead of allowing him to be nabbed or grabbed, anyhow and
willynilly, like our friend Sambo, the statute insists, by article 9,
that the binding shall not take place without the concurrence of “a
parish officer, or the parent, or next friend.” Article 10 provides,
that instead of rope-yarn, as in the case of Sambo aforesaid, the
binding shall only be effected with “paper or parchment,” and even
before enduring such very mild ligatures, article 13 declares, that
the boy is to be regularly “asked out,” before two Justices of the
Peace, and in case such boy shall be unwilling to be bound with “paper
and parchment,” “such Justices shall, and they are hereby required to
refuse, to sanction or approve of such binding.” The 12th clause allows
the practice of “liking,” or what, in electioneering cases, would be
called “treating;” and before any boy shall be bound as an apprentice,
“it shall be lawful for the intended master of such boy to have, and
receive such boy in such master’s house, on trial&mdash;or ‘liking’&mdash;for
any time not exceeding two calendar months.” In plain English, it
shall be lawful for the said master elect to tempt and bribe the said
apprentice, like Richard Ruggles, during eight weeks, by dinners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of “delicate cow-heel, with the sauce His Grace is so fond of,” and
suppers of hot sausages. And that the cow-heel and sausages may not be
too minutely subdivided, clause 14 enacts, that Mr. or Mrs. Chimney
Sweeper shall not have more than two apprentices on trial or “liking”
at the same time. The same considerate clause forbids Mr. or Mrs. C.
S. to have more than four apprentices at once, so that nothing like
the close packing, which so often incommodes the race of Africa in a
ship’s hold, may inconvenience the favoured sooterkins in the cellar. A
taste for music is not specially mentioned or protected: but as clause
17 empowers any two or more magistrates to hear “all complaints” of
hard or ill usage, the breaking of a fife or his pan’s pipes, over the
head of an apprentice, would be certain to be listened to, and in all
probability entail on the master a forfeit, fixed, by clause 16, at
“not exceeding 10<i>l.</i> nor less than 40<i>s.</i>” The 18th clause enjoins,
on all builders and bricklayers, under extremely heavy penalties, to
construct safe and comfortable chimneys that shall not be “hard to
climb;” and finally, as if a sweeper on such very eligible terms could
have anything to weep for, article 15 forbids, somewhat superfluously,
his crying about the streets!!! The incredulous reader who may wish
to verify this statement by reference to the Act itself, will find it
at full length, and shown “all up” in a well-conceived little volume,
called “The Mechanics of Law Making,” by a Member of Symond’s Inn.
He will there find too truly that, compared with the genuine black,
the sweeper is treated by law with as much tenderness as if each
climbing-boy were, like the stolen Montague, a well-born white young
gentleman in disguise. The tendency of such over-indulgent enactments
to spoil the youth of this country is evidenced in the fact, that
whilst the planter will give a considerable sum for a black assistant,
a white articled pupil is hardly acceptable as a present, and in most
cases, like Richard Ruggles, must have a handsome premium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> given
along with him to purchase him a master. As a mere matter of economy,
therefore, the matter is worth the consideration of parents and
guardians, and parish officers; whilst the advocates of equal justice
to all will imperatively insist that if the blacks cannot be treated
like whites, the whites ought to be treated as blacks. For my own part,
as a simple admirer of consistency, I cannot help thinking that the
whole system of apprenticeship, as regards its home practice, requires
to undergo a rigorous revision, and above all, that the act Anno Quarto
et Quinto Gulielmi IV. Regis, cap. 35, with all its sweeping clauses,
ought to be immediately repealed.</p>

<p>I <span class="smaller">NEVER</span> was in the pillory but once, which I must ever consider a
misfortune. For looking at all things, as I do, with a philosophical
and enquiring eye, and courting experience for the sake of my
fellow-creatures, I cannot but lament the short and imperfect
opportunity I enjoyed of filling that elevated situation, which so few
men are destined to occupy. It is a sort of Egg-Premiership; a place
above your fellows, but a place in which your hands are tied. You are
not without the established political vice, for you are not absolved
from turning.</p>

<p>Let me give a brief description of the short irregular glimpse I had of
men and things, while I was in Pillory Power. I was raised to it, as
many men are to high stations, by my errors. I merely made a mistake
of some sort or other in an answer in Chancery, not injurious to my
interests, and lo! the Recorder of London, with a suavity of manner
peculiar to himself, announced to me my intended promotion, and in due
time I was installed into office!</p>

<p>It was a fine day for the pillory; that is to say, it rained in
torrents. Those only who have had boarding and lodging like mine, can
estimate the comfort of having washing into the bargain.</p>

<p>It was about noon, when I was placed, like a statue, upon my wooden
pedestal; an hour probably chosen out of consideration to the innocent
little urchins then let out of school, for they are a race notoriously
fond of shying, pitching, jerking, pelting, flinging, slinging&mdash;in
short, professors of throwing in all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> branches. The public officer
presented me first with a north front, and there I was&mdash;“God save
the mark!”&mdash;like a cock at Shrovetide, or a lay-figure in a Shooting
Gallery!</p>

<p>The storm commenced. Stones began to spit&mdash;mud to
mizzle&mdash;cabbage-stalks thickened into a shower. Now and then came a
dead kitten&mdash;sometimes a living cur: anon an egg would hit me on the
eye, an offence I was obliged to wink at. There is a strange appetite
in human kind for pelting a fellow-creature. A travelling China-man
actually threw away twopence to have a pitch at me with a pipkin; a
Billinsgate huckster treated me with a few herrings, not by any means
too stale to be purchased in St. Giles’s; while the weekly halfpence
of the schoolboys went towards the support of a Costermonger and his
Donkey, who supplied them with eggs fit for throwing, and for nothing
else. I confess this last description of missiles, if missiles they
might be called that never miss’d, annoyed me more than all the rest;
however, there was no remedy. There I was forced to stand, taking up
my livery, and a vile livery it was; or, as a wag expressed it, “being
made free of the Peltmongers.”</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">WHAT MUST BE&mdash;MUST.</p>
</div>

<p>It was time to appeal to my resources. I had read somewhere of an
Italian, who, by dint of mental abstraction, had rendered himself
unconscious of the rack, and while the executioners were tugging,
wrenching, twisting, dislocating, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> breaking joints, sinews, and
bones, was perchance in fancy only performing his diurnal Gymnastics,
or undergoing an amicable Shampooing. The pillory was a milder
instrument than the rack, and I had naturally a lively imagination; it
seemed plausible, therefore, that I might make shift to be pelted in my
absence. To attain a scene as remote as possible from pain, I selected
one of absolute pleasure for the experiment; no other, in truth, than
that Persian Paradise, the Garden of Gul, at the Feast of Roses.
Flapping the wings of Fancy with all my might, I was speedily in those
Bowers of Bliss, and at high romps with Houri and Peri,&mdash;</p>

<p class="s5 center mtop1 mbot1">“Flinging roses at each other.”</p>

<p>But, alas, for mental abstraction! The very first bud hit me with
stone-like vehemence; my next rose, of the cabbage kind, breathed only
a rank cabbage fragrance; and in another moment the claws of a flying
cat scratched me back into myself; and there I was again, in full pelt
in the pillory!</p>

<p>My first fifteen minutes, the only quarter I met with, had now elapsed,
and my face was turned towards the East. The first object my one eye
fell upon was a heap of Macadamisation, and I confess I never thought
of calculating the number of stones in such a hillock, till I saw the
mob preparing to cast them up!</p>

<p>I expected to be lithographed on the spot! Instinct suggested to me
that the only way to save my life was by dying; so dropping my head and
hands, and closing my last eye with a terrific groan, I expired for
the present. The <i>ruse</i> took effect. Supposing me to be defunct, the
mob refused to kill me. Shouts of “Murder! Shame! Shame! No Pillory!”
burst from all quarters. The Pipkin-monger abused the Fishwoman, who
rated the Schoolboys; they in turn fell foul of the Costermonger,
who was hissing and groaning at the whole assembly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> and, finally,
a philanthropic Constable took the whole group into custody. In the
mean time I was taken down, laid with a sack over me in a cart, and
driven off to a Hospital, my body seeming a very proper present to
St. Bartholomew’s or St. Thomas’s, but my clothes fit for nothing but
<i>Guy’s</i>.</p>

<p>A<span class="smaller">MONGST</span> the agitations of the day, there is none more unaccountable
to a peaceable man in a time of peace, than the resistance to the
disbanding of the Yeomanry. It is of course impossible for anyone so
unconnected with party as myself, to divine the ministerial motives for
the measure; but judging from my own experience, I should have expected
that every private at least, would have mounted his best hunter to make
a jump at the offer. It appears, however, that a part of the military
body in question betrays a strong disinclination to dismiss; and
certain troops have even offered their services gratuitously, and been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
accepted, although it is evident that such a troop, to be consistent,
ought to refuse, when called upon to act, to make any charge whatever.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">“I VISH VE COULD BE DISBANDY’D.”</p>
</div>

<p>Amongst my Scottish reminiscences, I have a vivid recollection of once
encountering, on the road from Dundee to Perth, a party of soldiers,
having in their custody a poor fellow in the garb of a peasant, and
secured by handcuffs. He looked somewhat melancholy, as he well might,
under the uncertainty whether he was to be flogged within an inch
of his life, or shot to death, for such were the punishments of his
offence, which I understood to be desertion, or disbanding himself
without leave. It was natural to conclude, that no ordinary disgust
at a military life would induce a man to incur such heavy penalties.
With what gratitude would <i>he</i> have accepted his discharge! He would
surely have embraced the offer of being let off with the alacrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> of
gunpowder! And yet he was a regular, in the receipt of pay, and with
the prospect and opportunity, so rare to our yeomanry, of winning
laurels, and covering himself with glory!</p>

<p>It has been argued, on high authority, as a reason for retaining the
troops in question, that they are the most <i>constitutional</i> force that
could be selected; and truly of their general robustness there can be
but one opinion. However, if a domestic force of the kind ought to be
kept up, would it not be advisable, and humane, and fair, to give the
manufacturing body a turn, and form troops of the sedentary weavers and
other artisans, who stand so much more in need of out-of-door exercise?
The farmer, from the nature of his business, has <i>Field</i> Days enough,
to say nothing of the charges and throwings off he enjoys in hunting
and coursing, besides riding periodically to and from market, or the
neighbouring fairs. Indeed, the true English yeoman is generally,
thanks to these sports and employments, so constantly in the saddle,
that instead of volunteering into any cavalry, it might be supposed he
would be glad to feel his own legs a little, and enjoy the household
comforts of the chimney-corner and the elbow-chair. As regards their
effectiveness, I have had the pleasure of seeing a troop fire at a
target for a subscription silver cup; and it convinced me, that if I
had felt inclined to <i>roast</i> them, their own <i>fire</i> was the very best
one for my purpose. On another occasion I had the gratification of
beholding a charge, and as they succeeded in dispersing themselves, it
may be inferred that they might possibly do as much by a mob. Still
there seemed hardly excitement enough or amusement enough, except
to the spectators, in such playing at soldiers, to induce honest,
hearty, fox-hunting farmers, to wish to become veterans. To tell the
truth, I have heard before now, repentant grumblings from practical
agriculturists, who had too rashly adopted the uniform, and have seen
even their horses betray an inclination to back out of the line. The
more therefore is my surprise, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> all accounts, to hear that the
Yeomanry are so unwilling to be dispensed with, and relieved from
inactive service; for though the song tells us of a “Soldier tir’d of
war’s alarms,” there is no doubt that to a soldier of spirit, the most
tiresome thing in the world is to have no alarms at all.</p>

<p>In the mean time I have been at some pains to ascertain the sentiments
of the yeowomanry on the subject, and if they all feel in common
with Dame, the disbanding will be a most popular measure amongst the
farmers’ wives. I had no sooner communicated the news, through the
old lady’s trumpet, than she exclaimed, that “it was the best hearing
she had had for many a long day! The Sogering work unsettled both
men and horses&mdash;it took her husband’s head off his business, and it
threw herself off the old mare, at the last fair, along of a showman’s
trumpet. Besides, it set all the farm servants a-sogering too, and
when they went to the Wake, only old Roger came back again to say they
had all ’listed. They had more sense, however, than their master, for
they all wanted to be disbanded the next morning. As for the master,
he’d never been the same man since he put on the uniform; but had
got a hectoring swaggering way with him, as if everybody that didn’t
agree in politics, and especially about the Corn Bill, was to be bored
and slashed with sword and pistol. Then there was the constant dread
that in his practising, cut six would either come home to him, or
do a mischief to his neighbours; and after a reviewing there was no
bearing him, it put him so up in his stirrups, and on coming home he’d
think nothing of slivering off all the hollyoaks as he brandished and
flourished up the front garden. Another thing, and that was no trifle,
was the accidents; she couldn’t tell how it was, whether he thought too
much of himself and too little of his horse, but he always got a tumble
with the yeomanry, though he’d fox-hunt by the year together without
a fall. What was worse, a fall always made him crusty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> when he
was crusty, he made a point to get into his cups, which made him more
crusty still. Thank God, as yet he had never been of any use to his
country, and it was her daily prayer that he might never be called
out, as he had so many enemies and old grudges in the neighbourhood,
there would be sure to be murder on one side or the other. For my own
part,” she concluded, “I think the Parliament is quite right in these
hard times to turn the farmers’ swords again into ploughshares, for
they have less to care about the rising of rioters than the falling
of wheat.” The old lady then hunted out what she called a yeomanry
letter from her husband’s brother, and having her permission to make it
public, I have thought proper to christen it.</p>

barley in Kent. Besides the Earl, the great Duke did us the honour
to come and see the troops go through everything, and it rained all
the time. Except for the crops, a more unfavouring day couldn’t
have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> been picked out for man or beast, and many a nag has got a
consequential cough.</p>

<p>The ground was very good, with only one leap that nobody took, but
the weather was terribly against. It blew equinoxious gales, and
rained like watering pots with the rose off. But as somebody said,
one cannot always have their reviews cut and dry.</p>

<p>We set out from Ashford at ten, and was two hours getting to Bumper
Daggle Bottom Common, but it’s full six mile. The Bumper Daggle’s
dress is rather handsome and fighting like&mdash;blue, having a turn-up
with white, and we might have been called cap-a-pee, but Mr. P.,
the contractor of our caps, made them all too small for our heads.
Luckily the clothes fit, except Mr. Lambert’s, who couldn’t find
a jacket big enough; but he scorned to shrink, and wore it loose
on his shoulder like a hussar. As for arms, we had all sorts, and
as regards horses, I am sorry to say all sorts of legs&mdash;what with
splints, and quitters, and ring-bone, and grease. The Major’s, I
noticed, had a bad spavin, and was no better for being fired with
a ramrod, which old Clinker, the blacksmith, forgot to take out of
his piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>We mustard very strong,&mdash;about sixty&mdash;besides two volunteers, one
an invalid, because he had been ordered to ride for exercise, and
the other because he had nothing else to do, and he did nothing
when he came. We must have been a disagreeable site to eyes as is
unaffected towards Government,&mdash;though how Hopper’s horse would
behave in putting down riots I can’t guess, for he did nothing
but make revolutions himself, as if he was still in the thrashing
mill. But you know yeomanry an’t reglers, and can’t be expected
to be veterans all at once. The worst of our mistakes was about
the cullers. Old Ensign Cobb, of the White Horse, has a Political
Union club meets at his house, and when he came to unfurl, he had
brought the wrong flag: instead of “Royal Bumper Daggle,” it was
“No Boromongers.” It made a reglar horse laugh among the cavalry;
and old Cobb took such dudgeon at us, he deserted home to the White
Horse, and cut the concern without drawing a sword.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> The Captain
ordered Jack Blower to sound the recall to him, but some wag on the
rout had stuck a bung up his trumpet; and he gallopped off just as
crusty about it as old Cobb. Our next trouble was with Simkin, but
you know he is anything but Simkin and Martial. He rid one of his
own docked waggon-horses&mdash;but for appearance sake had tied on a
long regulation false tale, that made his horse kick astonishing,
till his four loose shoes flew off like a game at koits. Of course
nobody liked to stand nigh him, and he was obliged to be drawn up
in single order by himself, but not having any one to talk to, he
soon got weary of it, and left the ground. This was some excuse
for him&mdash;but not for Dale, that deserted from his company,&mdash;some
said his horse bolted with him, but I’ll swear I seed him spur.
Up to this we had only one more deserter, and that was Marks, on
his iron-gray mare, for she heard her foal whinnying at home, and
attended to that call more than to a deaf and dumb trumpet. Biggs
didn’t come at all; he had his nag stole that very morning, as it
was waiting for him, pistols and all.</p>

<p>What with these goings off and gaps our ranks got in such disorder
that the Earl, tho’ he is a Tory, was obliged to act as a rank
Reformer. We got into line middling well, as far as the different
sizes of our horses would admit, and the Duke rode up and down us,
and I am sorry to say was compelled to a reprimand. Morgan Giles
had been at a fox-hunt the day before, and persisted in wearing the
brush as a feather in his cap. As fox tails isn’t regulation, his
Grace ordered it out, but Morgan was very high, and at last threw
up his commission into a tree and trotted home to Wickham Hall,
along with private Dick, who, as Morgan’s whipper in, thought he
was under obligations to follow his master.</p>

<p>We got thro’ sword exercise decent well,&mdash;only Barber shaved
Croft’s mare with his saber, which he needn’t have done, as she was
clipt before; and Holdsworth slashed off his cob’s off ear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> It
was cut and run with her in course; and I hope he got safe home.
We don’t know what Hawksley might have thrusted, as his sword
objected to be called out in wet weather, and stuck to its sheath
like pitch; but he went thro’ all the cuts very correct with his
umbrella. For my own part, candour compels to state I swished off
my left hand man’s feather; but tho’ it might have been worse,
and I apologised as well as I could for my horse fretting, he was
foolish enough to huff at, and swear was done on purpose, and so
gallopped home, I suspect, to write me a calling out challenge.
Challenge or not, if I fight him with anything but fists, I’m not
one of the Yeomanry. An accident’s an accident, and much more
pardonable than Hawksley opening his umbrella plump in the face of
the Captain’s blood charger; and ten times more mortifying for an
officer to be carried back willy-nilly to Ashford, in the middle
of the Review. Luckily before Hawksley frightened any more, he was
called off to hold his umbrella over Mrs. H., as Mrs. Morgan had
taken in nine ladies, and could not accommodate more in her close
carriage, without making it too close.</p>

<p>After sword exercise we shot pistols, and I must say, very well
and distinct; only, old Dunn didn’t fire; but he’s deaf as a post,
and I wonder how he was called out. Talking of volleys, I am sorry
to say we fired one before without word of command; but it was all
thro’ Day on his shooting pony putting up a partridge, and in the
heat of the moment letting fly, and as he is our fugleman we all
did the same. Lucky for the bird it was very strong on the wing,
or the troop must have brought it down; howsomever the Earl looked
very grave, and said something that Day didn’t choose to take from
him, being a qualified man, and taking out a reglar license, so
he went off to his own ground, where he might shoot without being
called to account. Contrary to reason and expectation, there was
very few horses shied at the firing; but we saw Bluff lying full
length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> and was afraid it was a bust; but we found his horse,
being a very quiet one, had run away from the noise. He was throwd
on his back in the mud, but refused to leave the ground. Being a
man of spirit, and military inclind, he got up behind Bates; but
Bates’s horse objecting to such back-gammon, reared and threw
doublets. As his knees was broke, Bates and Bluff was forced to
lead him away, and the troop lost two more men, tho’ for once
against their own wills.</p>

<p>As for Roper he had bragged how he could stand fire, but seeing a
great light over the village, he set off full Swing to look after
his ricks and barns.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was charging, and between you and me, I
was most anxious about that, as many of us could only ride up to
a certain <i>pitch</i>. As you’ve often been throwd you’ll know what I
mean: to tell the truth, when the word came, I seed some lay hold
of their saddles, but Barnes had better have laid hold of anything
else in the world, for it turn’d round with him at the first
start. Simpkin fell at the same time insensibly, but the doctor
dismounted and was very happy to attend him without making any
charge whatever. All the rest went off gallantly, either gallopping
or cantering, tho’ as they say at Canterbury races, their was
some wonderful tailing on account of the difference of the nags.
Grimsby’s mare was the last of the lot, and for her backwardness in
charging we called her the Mare of Bristol, but he took the jest
no better than Cobb did, and when we wheel’d to the right he was
left. Between friends, I was not sorry when the word came to pull
up,&mdash;such crossing, and josling, and foul riding; but two farmers
seemed to like it, for they never halted when the rest did, but
gallopped on out of sight. I have since heard they had matched
their two nags the day before to run two miles for a sovereign;
I don’t think a sovereign should divert a man from his king: but
I can’t write the result as they newer came back,&mdash;I suppose on
account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> the wet. The rains, to speak cavalry like, had got
beyond bearing rains; and when we formed line again it was like a
laundress’s clothes line, for there wasn’t a dry shirt on it. One
man on a lame horse rode particularly restive, and objected in such
critical weather to a long review. He wouldn’t be cholera morbus’d,
he said, for Duke or Devil, but should put his horse up, and go
home by the blue Stage; by way of answer he was ordered to give up
his arms and his jacket, which he did very off hand, as it was wet
thro’. Howsomever it was thought prudent to dispense with us till
fine weather, so we was formed into a circle&mdash;9 bobble square, and
the Duke thanked us in a short speech for being so regular, and
loyal, and soldier-like, after which every man that had kept his
seat gave three cheers.</p>

<p>On the whole the thing might have been very gratifying, but on
reviewing the Field day, the asthmas and agues are uncommonly
numerous, and to say nothing of the horses that are amiss with
coffs and colds&mdash;there are three dead and seven lame for life. The
Earl has been very much blamed under the rose among the privates,
for fixing on a Hunting day, which I forgot to say, carried away a
dozen that were mounted on their hunters. I am sorry to say there
was so few left at the end of all, as to suffer themselves to be
hissed into the town by the little boys and gals, and called the
Horse Gomerils; and that consequently the corpse, as a body, is as
good as defunct. Not that there were many resign’d at the end of
the review, as his Lordship gave a grand dinner on the following
day to the troop: but I am sorry to say, a great many was so
unhandsome as to throw up the very day after. The common excuse
among them was something of not liking to wet their swords against
their countrymen.</p>

<p>For my own part as the yomanry cannot go on, I shall stick to it
honorably, and as any man of spirit would do in my case; but dont
be afraid of my attending Market, come what will, and selling the
barley at the best quotation.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I forgot to tell what will make you laugh. Barlow wouldn’t
ride with spurs, because, he said, they made his horse prick his
ears. Our poor corps, small as it is, I understand is like to act
in divisions. Some wish to be infantry instead of cavalry; and the
farmers from the hop grounds want to be Polish Lancers.</p>

<p>I have just learned Ballard, and nine more of the men, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> ordered
to keep the ground; but it seems they left before the Troop came on
it. They say in excuse, they stood in the rain till they were ready
to drop; and as we didn’t come an hour after time, they thought
everything was postponed. “None but the brave,” they said, “deserve
the fair;” and till it <i>was</i> fair, they wouldn’t attend again.</p>

<p>The mare you lent Ballard, I am sorry to say, got kicked in
several places, and had her shoulder put out; we was advised to
give her a swim in the sea, and I am still more sorry to say, in
swimming her we drowned her. As for my own nag, I am afraid he has
got string-halt; but one comfort is, I think it diverts him from
kicking.</p>

<p>M<span class="smaller">Y</span> father being what is called a serious tallow-chandler, having
supplied the Baptist Meeting-house of Nantwich with <i>dips</i> for many
years, intended to make me a field-preaching minister. Alas! <i>my</i> books
were plays, <i>my</i> sermons soliloquies. You would not have wondered, had
you seen me then, with my large dark eyes, my permanent nose, and a
mouth to which my picture does but scanty justice. In large theatres
these may be but secondary considerations; but a figure symmetrical as
mine must have been seen through all space. Accordingly, I eloped with
the young lady who used to rehearse my heroines with me, and came to
London, where, after we had studied together till I was in debt, and
she, as “ladies wish to be who love their lords,” I began applying to
the managers for leave to make my <i>debût</i>. I will not describe to you
the neglect and rudeness I experienced! It did not abate my enthusiasm:
but so true it is, “while the grass grows”&mdash;the proverb is somewhat
musty,&mdash;that I had soon nothing but musty bread on which to feed my
hopes, and hopeful wife. One burning spring day I roved as far as the
fields near Greenwich, and, book in hand, went through Romeo, though
but to a shy audience, for the sheep all took to their trotters, and
the crows to their wings, and not without <i>caws</i>. (That joke <i>was</i>
mine, let who will have claimed it.)</p>

away, looking heartily ashamed of himself. The gentleman continued,
“Mr. Richardson and Company are now acting at the fair. I am his
scene-painter; see here, I have sketched you in your happiest attitude.
Come with me.” We went to the booth. I was hired; but unluckily, my
powers being suited for a larger stage, so overpowered my present
audience, that I was taken out of all speaking parts, for fear of
fatal consequences. Nevertheless, my grace in processions soon raised
so much jealousy against me, that in the autumn Master recommended me
to one of the Minors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> town, where, for twice as much salary, I was
never expected to appear before the curtain, but to make myself useful
among the carpenters and scene-shifters. That Christmas, during the
rehearsal of a Pantomime, four of us were set to catch an Harlequin,
each to hold the corner of a blanket, and be ready for his jump
through the scene. Alas! one gentleman brought his pot, and one his
pipe, and the third an inclination for a snooze. Two were asleep, and
one draining the last drops of stout from the pewter. I alone upheld
my corner from the boards, when the awful leap came on us, like a
star-shoot. I still see the momentary gleam of that strait, spangled,
fish-like, head-long figure. Can, candle, bottle, pipes, all crashed
beneath the heavy tumbler. With a torrent of apologies, we scrambled
up in the dark, to raise the fallen hero; but there he lay, on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
face, with legs and arms outspread, as we could feel, without sense,
or sound, or motion, cold, stiff, and <i>dead</i>! For an instant all was
horrid silence; we were as breathless as he. I resolved to give myself
up to justice, yet found voice in the boldness of innocence to shout
“Help! Lights! All his bones are broken!” “And all yours <i>shall</i> be,
ye dogs!” cried a voice. We looked up; there stood one Harlequin over
us alive; there lay another under us, without a chance of ever more
peeping through the blanket of the dark. That the speaker was no ghost
we were soon convinced, as his magic bat battered us. The truth was, he
had thrown at us the stuffed Harlequin used in flying ascents, to try
our vigilance, before he risked his own neck. I felt, however, that I
<i>might</i> have been of a party who had killed a man. It was a judgment
on me for being in such a place, with any less excuse than that of
acting Romeo. I took my wife and babe back to Cheshire. We knelt at my
father’s feet, promising to serve in the shop; fortunately it was one
of his melting days: he raised us to his arm;&mdash;we formed a <i>tableau
generale</i>&mdash;and the curtain dropped.</p>

<p>I <span class="smaller">WAS</span> once&mdash;for a few hours only&mdash;in the militia. I suspect I was in
part answerable for my own mishap. There is a story in Joe Miller of
a man, who, being <i>pressed</i> to serve his Majesty on another element,
pleaded his polite breeding, to the gang, as a good ground of
exemption: but was told that the crew being a set of sad unmannerly
dogs, a Chesterfield was the very character they wanted. The
militia-men acted, I presume, on the same principle. Their customary
schedule was forwarded to me, at Brighton, to fill up, and in a moment
of incautious hilarity&mdash;induced, perhaps, by the absence of all
business or employment, except pleasure&mdash;I wrote myself down in the
descriptive column as “<i>Quite a Gentleman</i>.”</p>

<p>The consequence followed immediately. A precept, addressed by the High
Constable of Westminster to the Low ditto of the parish of St. M*****,
and endorsed with my name, informed me that it had turned up in that
involuntary lottery, the Ballot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>At sight of the Orderly, who thought proper to deliver the document
into no other hands than mine, my mother-in-law cried, and my wife
fainted on the spot. They had no notion of any distinctions in military
service&mdash;a soldier was a soldier&mdash;and they imagined that, on the very
morrow, I might be ordered abroad to a fresh Waterloo. They were
unfortunately ignorant of that benevolent provision which absolved the
militia from going out of the kingdom&mdash;“except in case of an invasion.”
In vain I represented that we were “locals;” they had heard of local
diseases, and thought there might be wounds of the same description. In
vain I explained that we were not troops of the line;&mdash;they could see
nothing to choose between being shot in a line, or in any other figure.
I told them next that I was not obliged to serve myself; but they
answered, “’twas so much the harder I should be obliged to serve any
one else.” My being sent abroad, they said, would be the death of them;
for they had witnessed, at Ramsgate, the embarkation of the Walcheren
expedition, and too well remembered “the misery of the soldiers’ wives
at seeing their husbands in <i>transports</i>!”</p>

<p>I told them that, at the very worst, if I <i>should</i> be sent abroad,
there was no reason why I should not return again; but they both
declared, they never did, and never would believe in those “Returns of
the Killed and Wounded.”</p>

<p>The discussion was in this stage when it was interrupted by another
loud single knock at the door, a report equal in its effects on us to
that of the memorable cannon-shot at Brussels; and before we could
recover ourselves, a strapping Serjeant entered the parlour with a huge
bow, or rather rain-bow, of party-coloured ribbons in his cap. He came,
he said to offer a substitute for me; but I was prevented from reply by
the indignant females asking him in the same breath, “Who and what did
he think <i>could</i> be a substitute for a son and a husband?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>The poor Serjeant looked foolish enough at this turn; but he was still
more abashed when the two anxious Ladies began to cross-examine him
on the length of his services abroad, and the number of his wounds,
the campaigns of the Militia-man having been confined doubtless to
Hounslow, and his bodily marks militant to the three stripes on his
sleeve. Parrying these awkward questions he endeavoured to prevail upon
me to see the proposed proxy, a fine young fellow, he assured me, of
unusual stature; but I told him it was quite an indifferent point with
me whether he was 6-feet-2 or 2-feet-6, in short whether he was as tall
as the flag or “under the standard.”</p>

<p>The truth is, I reflected that it was a time of profound peace, that a
civil war, or an invasion, was very unlikely; and as for an occasional
drill, that I could make shift, like Lavater, to right-about-face.</p>

<p>Accordingly I declined seeing the substitute, and dismissed the
Serjeant with a note to the War-Secretary to this purport:&mdash;“That
I considered myself <i>drawn</i>; and expected therefore to be well
<i>quarter’d</i>. That, under the circumstances of the country, it would
probably be unnecessary for militia-men ‘to be mustarded;’ but that
if his Majesty did ‘<i>call me out</i>,’ I hoped I should ‘<i>give him
satisfaction</i>.’”</p>

<p>The females were far from being pleased with this billet. They talked
a great deal of moral suicide, wilful murder, and seeking the bubble
reputation in the cannon’s mouth; but I shall ever think that I took
the proper course, for, after the lapse of a few hours, two more of
the General’s red-coats, or General postmen, brought me a large packet
sealed with the War-office Seal, and superscribed “Henry Hardinge;” by
which I was officially absolved from serving on Horse, or on Foot, or
on both together, then and thereafter.</p>

<p>And why, I know not&mdash;unless his Majesty doubted the handsomeness of
discharging me in particular, without letting off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> rest;&mdash;but so it
was, that in a short time afterwards there issued a proclamation, by
which the services of all militia-men were for the present dispensed
with,&mdash;and we were left to pursue our several avocations,&mdash;of course,
all the lighter in our <i>spirits</i> for being <i>disembodied</i>.</p>

<p class="s5 center">“When the butt is out, we will drink water: not a drop
before.”&mdash;T<span class="smaller">EMPEST</span>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />


<p>I <span class="smaller">HAVE</span> Stefano’s aversion to Water. I never take any by chance into
my mouth, without the proneness of our Tritons and Dolphins of the
Fountain,&mdash;to spout it forth again. It is, on the palate, as in tubs
and hand-basins, egregiously washy. It hath not for me, even what
is called “an amiable weakness.” For the sake only of quantity, not
quality, do I sometimes adulterate my Cogniac or Geneva with the
flimsy fluid. Aquarius is not my sign; at the praises heaped on Sir
Hugh Myddelton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> for leading his trite streamlet up to London,&mdash;my lip
curleth. Methinks if such a sloppy labour could at one time more than
another betray a misguided taste, it was in those days, when we are
told,&mdash;“The Grete Conduict, in Chepe, did runne forth Wyne.” And then
to hear talk withal of the New River <i>Head</i>,&mdash;as if, forsooth, the weak
current poured even from Ware unto London, were capable of that goodly
headed capital, the <i>caput</i>, of Stout Porter, or lusty Ale.</p>

<p>The taste for aquatics is none of mine. I laugh at Cowes’&mdash;it should
be Calves’&mdash;Regattas; it passeth my understanding, to conceive the
pleasure of contending with all your sail and sea, your might and
main, for a prize cup of water. Gentle reader, if ever we two should
encounter at good-men’s feasts, say not before me, that “your mouth
waters,” for fear of my compelled rejoinder, “The more pump you!”</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">THE ARCH-ENEMY.</p>
</div>

<p>I am told&mdash;<i>Dic mihi</i>&mdash;by Sir Lauder Dick, that the great floods is
Morayshire destroyed I know not how many Scottish bridges,&mdash;and I
believe it. The element was always our Arch-Enemy. Witness the Deluge,
when the whole human-kind would have perished, with water on the
chest, but for Noah’s chest on the water. Drowning&mdash;by some called
Dying made Easy&mdash;is to my notions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> horrible. Conceive an unfortunate
gentleman&mdash;not by any means thirsty&mdash;compelled to swill gulp after gulp
of the vapid fluid, even to swelling, “as the water you know will swell
a man.” If I said I would rather be hanged, it would be but the truth;
although “Veritas in <i>Puteo</i>” hath given me almost a disrelish for
truth itself.</p>

<p>Excepting their imaginary Castaly, I should be glad to know what poet
hath sung ever in the praise of Water? Of wine, many. “Tak <i>Tent</i>,”
saith the Scottish Burns; “O, was ye at the <i>Sherry</i>?”&mdash;singeth
another. The lofty Douglas, in commending Norval, thus hinteth his
cellar; “His <i>Port</i> I like.” Shakspeare discourseth eloquently of both
as “Red and white,” and addeth,&mdash;“with sweet and cunning hand <i>laid
on</i>;”&mdash;i.e. laid on in pipes. For Madeira, see Bowles of it; and the
Muse of Pringle luxuriates in the Cape. Then is there also Mountain
celebrated by Pope,&mdash;“The Shepherd loves the mountain,”&mdash;to Moslem,
forbidden draught; yet which Mahomet would condescend to fetch himself,
if it failed in coming to hand. Sack, too,&mdash;as dear to Oriental
Sultanas as his Malmsey to Clarence,&mdash;is by Byron touched on in his
Corsair; but then, through some Koran-scrupulousness perchance, they
take it&mdash;in Water!</p>

<p>Praise there hath been of water; but, as became the subject, in prose;
M. hath written a volume, I am told, in its commendation, and above
all of its nutritive quality; and truly to see it floating the Victory
with all her armament and complement of guns, and men, one must confess
there is some <i>support</i> in it&mdash;at least as an outward application! but
then taken internally, look at the wreck of the Royal George!</p>

<p>The mention of Men-of-War, bringeth to mind, opportunely, certain
marine reminiscences, pertinent to this subject, referring some
years backward, when, with other uniform than my present invariable
sables, I was stationed at *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, on the coast of Sussex. Little
as my present-tense habits and occupations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> savour of the past
sea-service,&mdash;yet, reader, in the Navy List amongst the Commanders, or
years by-gone in the Ship’s Books of H.M.S Hyperion, presently lying
in the sequestered harbour of Newhaven, thou wilt find occurring the
surname of Hood; a name associated by friends, marine and mechanic,
with a contrivance, for expelling the old enemy, water, by a novel
construction of Ships’ pumps.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">RUNNING SPIRITS.</p>
</div>

<p>Stanchest of my sect&mdash;the Adam’s-Ale-shunners&mdash;wert thou, old
Samuel Spiller! in the muster-roll charactered an Able Seaman; but
most notable for a Landsman’s aversion to unmitigated Water, hard,
or soft&mdash;fresh or salt! A petty Officer wert thou in that armed
band <i>versus</i> contraband, the Coast Blockade, by some miscalled
the Preventive Service, if service it be to prevent the influx of
wholesome spirits. To do the smuggler bare justice, no seaman,
Nelson-bred, payeth greater reverence, or obedience to that signal
sentence,&mdash;“England expects every man to <i>do</i> his <i>duty</i>!” than he.
Thine, Spiller, was done to the uttermost. Spirits, legal or illegal,
in tub or flask, or pewter measure, didst thou inexorably seize, and
gauger-like try the depth thereof,&mdash;thy Royal Master, His Majesty, at
the latter end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> the seizures, faring no better than thy own begotten
sea-urchin, of whom, one day remarking that&mdash;“he took after his
father,” the young would-be Trinculo retorted, “Father never leaveth
none to take.” There were strange rumours afloat, and ashore&mdash;Samuel!
of thy unprofitable vigilance. Many an illicit <i>Child</i>, i.e. a small
keg, hath been laid at thy door. Thou hadst a becoming respect for
thy comrades, as brave men and true, who could stand fire, but the
smugglers, I fear, were ranked a streak higher, as men who could stand
treat. Still were thy misdeeds like much of thy own beverage&mdash;beyond
proof. Even as those delinquent utterers of base notes, who swallow
their own dangerous forgeries, so didst thou gulp down whatever
might else have appeared against thee in evidence. There was no
entrapping thee, like rat, or weasel in that Gin, from which deriving a
sea-peerage, thou wert commonly known&mdash;with no offence, I trust, to the
Noble Vassal of Kensington&mdash;as Lord Hollands.</p>

<p>It was by way of water-penance for one of these Cassio-like
derelictions of Mine Ancient, that one evening&mdash;the evening succeeding
the Great Sea Tempest of 1814&mdash;I gave him charge of a boat’s crew, to
bring in sundry fragmental relics of some shipwreckt Argosy, that were
reported to be adrift in our offing. In two hours he returned, and like
Venator and Piscator, we immediately fell into dialogue,&mdash;Piscator,
i.e. Spiller, “for fear of dripping the carpet,” standing aloof, a vox
et preterea nihil, in a dark entry.</p>

<p>“Well, Spiller,”&mdash;my phraseology was not then inoculated with the
quaintness it hath since imbibed from after lecture&mdash;“Well, Spiller,
what have you picked up?”</p>

<p>“A jib-boom, I think, Sir, a capital spar; and part of a Ship’s starn.
The ‘Planter of Barbadies’&mdash;famous place for rum, Sir.”</p>

<p>“Was there any sea&mdash;are you wet?”</p>

<p>“Only up to my middle, Sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;stow away the wreck, and go to your grog. Tell Bunce to
give you all double allowance.”</p>

<p>“Thank your honour’s honour!”</p>

<p>The voice ceased: and a pair of ponderous sea-soles, with tramp audible
as the marble foot of the Spectre in Giovanni, went hurrying down our
main-hatchway. Certain misgivings of a discrepancy between the imputed
drenching and the weather, an appeal askance of the rum cask, joined
with a curiosity perchance, to inspect the ship-fragments&mdash;our flottsom
and jettsom, led me soon afterwards below, and there, in the mess-room,
sate mine officer, high and dry, with a huge tankard in his starboard
hand. I made an obvious remark on it, and had an answer&mdash;for Michael
Spiller was no adept in the Chesterfieldian refinements&mdash;from the
interior of the drinking-vessel&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your Honour’s right, and I ax your Honour’s pardon. I warn’t wet! but
I was <i>very</i> dry!”</p>

<p>“Peregrine and Gauntlet heard the sound of the stump ascending the
wooden staircase with such velocity, that they at first mistook
it for the application of drum-sticks to the head of an empty
barrel.”&mdash;P<span class="smaller">EREGRINE</span> P<span class="smaller">ICKLE</span>.</p>

</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>E<span class="smaller">VER</span> since the year 1799, I have had, in the coachman phrase, an off
leg and a near one; the right limb, thanks to a twelve-pounder, lies
somewhere at Seringapatam, its twin-brother being at this moment under
a table at Brighton. In plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> English, I have a wooden leg. Being thus
deprived of half of the implements for marching, I equitably retired,
on half-pay, from a marching regiment, and embarked what remained
of my body, for the land of its nativity, literally fulfilling the
description of man, “with one foot on sea and one on shore,” in the
Shakspearian song.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said and sung of our wooden walls and hearts of
oak, but legs of ditto make but an inglorious figure on the ocean. No
wrestler from Cornwall or Devonshire ever received half so many fair
back-falls as I, the least roll of the vessel&mdash;and the equinoctial
gales were in full blow&mdash;making me lose, I was going to say, my feet.
I might have walked in a dead calm, and as a soldier accustomed to
exercise, and moreover a foot soldier, and used to walking, I felt a
great inclination to pace up and down the deck, but a general protest
from the cabins put an end to my promenade. As Lear recommends, my
wooden hoofs ought to have been “shod with felt.”</p>

<p>At last the voyage terminated, and in my eagerness to land, I got
into a fishing-boat, which put me ashore at Dungeness. Those who
have enjoyed a ramble over its extensive shingle, will believe that
I soon obtained abundance of exercise in walking with a wooden leg
among its loose pebbles; in fact, when I arrived at Lydd, I was, as
the cricketers say, “stumped out.” It was anything but one of Foote’s
farces.</p>

<p class="mbot1">The next morning saw me in sight of home,&mdash;as a provincial bard says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“But when home gleams upon the wanderer’s eye,</div>
    <div class="verse">Quicken his steps&mdash;he almost seems to fly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="mtop1 mbot1">But I wish he had seen me doing my last half mile over Swingfield Hill.
I found its deep sand anything but a quicksand, in spite of a distinct
glimpse of the paternal roof. I am convinced, when “Fleet Camilla
scours the plain,” she does not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> it with sand. At last I stood at
the lodge-gate, which opened, and let me into a long avenue, the path
of which had been newly gravelled, but not well rolled; accordingly,
I cut out considerable work for myself and the gardener, who, as he
watched the holes I picked in his performance, seemed to look on my
advance much as Apollyon did on Pilgrim’s Progress. By way of relief,
I got upon the grass, but my wooden leg, though it was a blackleg,
did not thrive much upon the turf. Arrived at the house door, filial
anxiety caused me to forget to scrape and wipe, and I proceeded to make
a fishy pattern of soles and dabs up the stair carpet. The good wife in
the Scotch song says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“His very foot has music in’t,</div>
    <div class="verse">As he comes up the stair.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="mtop1 mbot1">If there was any music in mine, it was in the stump, which played a
sort of “Dead March in Saul,” up to the landing-place, where the sound
and sight of my Birnam wood coming to Dunsinane threw my poor mother
into a Macbeth fit of horror, for the preparatory letter which should
have broken my leg to her, had been lost on its passage. As for my
father, I will not attempt to describe his transport, for I came upon
him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“As fools rush in where angels fear to tread;”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="p0 mtop1">and Gabriel or Michael would not have escaped a volley for treading on
his gouty foot. At the same moment, Margaret and Louisa, with sisterly
impetuosity, threw themselves on my neck, and not being attentive to my
“outplay or loose leg,” according to Sir Thomas Parkyn’s “Instructions
for Wrestling,” the result was a “hanging trippet.” “A hanging trippet
is when you put your toe behind your adversary’s heel, on the same
side, with a design to hook his leg up forwards, and throw him on his
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader will guess my satisfaction when night came, and allowed
me to rid myself of my unlucky limb. Fatigued with my walk through
dry sand and wet gravel, exhausted by excessive emotion, and, maybe,
a little flustered by dipping into the cup of welcome, I literally
tumbled into bed, and was soon dreaming of running races and leaping
for wagers, gallopading, waltzing, and other feats of a biped, when I
was suddenly aroused by shrill screams of “Thieves!” and “Murder!” with
a more hoarse call for “Frank! Frank!” There were burglars, in fact,
in the house, who were packing and preparing to elope with the family
plate, without the consent of parents. It was natural for the latter to
call a son and a soldier to the rescue, but son or soldier never came
in time to start for the plate; not that I wanted zeal or courage, or
arms, but I wanted that unlucky limb, and I groped about a full half
hour in the dark, before I could lay my hand upon my leg.</p>

<p>The next morning I took a solitary stroll before breakfast to look at
the estate; but during my absence abroad, some exchanges of land had
taken place with our neighbour, Sir Theophilus. The consequence was, in
taking my wood through a wood of his, but which had formerly been our
own, and going with my “best leg foremost,” as a man in my predicament
always does, I popped it into a man-trap. Thus my timber failed me at a
pinch when it might really have stood my friend. Luckily the trap was
one of the humane sort;&mdash;but it was far from pleasant to stand in it
for two hours calling out for Leg Bail.</p>

<p>I could give many more instances of scrapes, besides the perpetual
hobble which my wooden leg brought me into, but I will mention only
one. At the persuasion of my friends, a few years ago, I stood for Rye,
but the electors, perhaps, thought I only half stood for it, for they
gave me nothing but split votes. It was perhaps as well that I did not
go into the House, for with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> two such odd legs I could never properly
have “paired off.” The election expenses, however, pressed, heavily on
my pocket, and to defray them, and all for one Wooden Leg, I had to cut
down some thousand loads of timber.</p>

history of the pestilence, I shall make bold to write down herein, not
only on account of the strangeness of the event, but also because it
carries a moral pick-a-back, as a good story ought to do.</p>

<p>It is a notoriously known fact, as collected from the bills of
mortality, that there died of the plague in the mere metropolis
a matter of some hundreds of thousands of human souls; yet
notwithstanding this most awful warning to evil doers, the land did

that the like was never known before or after; the City of Lon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>don,
especially, being overrun with bands of thieves and murtherers, against
whom there was little or no check, the civical police having been
utterly disbanded and disrupt during the ravages of the pestilence.
Neither did men’s minds turn for some time towards the mere safeguard
of property, being still distracted with personal fears, for although
the pest had, as it were, died of the excess of its own violence, yet
from time to time there arose flying rumours of fresh breakings out of
the malady. The small-pox and the malignant fever being the prolific
parents of such like alarms. Accordingly many notable robberies and
divers grievous murthers having been acted with impunity during the
horrible crisis of the pest, those which had before been wicked were
now hardened, and became a thousand times worse, till the city and the
neighbourhood thereof seemed given in prey to devils, who had been
loosened for a season from the everlasting fetters of the law.</p>

<p>Now four of these desperadoes having met together at the Dolphin in
Deptford, they laid a plot together to rob a certain lone mansion house
which stood betwixt the Thames marshes and the Forest of Hainault, and
which was left in the charge of only one man, the family being gone
off to another mansion house in the county of Wiltshire, for the sake
of a more wholesome air. And the manner of the plot was this: one of
the villains going in a feigned voice was to knock at the front-door
and beg piteously for a night’s shelter, and then the door, being
opened, the other knaves were to rush in and bind the serving-man, or
murther him, as might seem best, and so taking his keys they were to
ransack the house, where they expected to find a good store of plate.
Accordingly, one Friday, at the dead of the night, they set forth,
having for leader a fellow that was named Blackface, by reason of a
vizard which he wore always on such errands, diverting themselves by
the way with laying out each man his share of the booty in the manner
that pleased him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> best, wine and the women of Lewkener’s Lane coming
in you may be sure for the main burthen of the song. At last they
entered the fore-court of the house which they were to rob, and which
was as silent as death, and as dark, excepting a glimmer from one
window towards the top. Blackface then, as agreed upon, began to beat
at the door, but being flushed with drink, instead of entreating for
an entrance, he shouted out to the serving-man, bidding him with many
terrible oaths to come down and to render up his keys, for that they
were come to relieve him of his charge.</p>

<p>“In the name of God, my masters,” cried the serving-man from the
window, “what do you want here?”</p>

<p>“We are come,” returned Blackface, “to relieve you of your trust, so
throw us down your keys.”</p>

<p>“An that be all,” said the serving-man, whose name was Adams, “wait but
a little while and you shall have the keys and my place to boot. Come
again but a few hours hence, and you shall find me dead, when you may
do with me and my trust as you list.”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” cries Blackface, “no preaching, but come down and open,
or we will bring fire and faggot to the door.”</p>

<p>“Ye shall not need,” answered Adams, “hearken only to what I say, and
you shall have free passage; but I give you fair warning, though I
be but a single man, and without weapon, and sick even unto death,
yet shall your coming in cost you as many lives as ye bear amongst
you, for within these walls there is a dismal giant that hath slain
his thousands, even the plague.” At these dreary words the courage of
the robbers was taken somewhat aback, but Blackface spirited them on,
saying it was no doubt an invention to deter them from the spoil.</p>

<p>“Alas,” answered Adams, who overheard their argument, “what I say is
the solemn and sorrowful truth, and which I am speaking for the last
time, for I shall never see to-morrow’s blessed sun. As for the door,
I will open it to you with my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> hands, beseeching you for your own
sakes to stand a little apart, and out of the taint of my breath, which
is sure destruction. There is one child herein a dead corpse, as you
shall behold if you have so much courage, for it lieth unburied in the
hall.” So saying he descended, and presently flung open the hall door,
the villains withdrawing a little backward, and they saw verily by the
light of a rush wick which he carried, that he was lapt only in a white
sheet, and looking very pale and ghost-like, with a most dismal black
circle round each of his eyes.</p>

      alt="" /></a>
  <p class="caption mbot1">THE COMMON LOT.</p>
</div>

<p>“If ye disbelieve me still,” he said, “look inwards when I draw back
from the door, and ye shall see what was a living child this day, but
is now a corpse hastening to corruption. Alas! in the midst of life we
are in death: she was seized at play.” With these words he drew aside,
and the robbers looking through the door, perceived it was even as
he said, for the dead body of the child was lying on the hall table,
with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> same black ring round its eyes, and dressed in brocade and
riband as though death had carried it off, even as he said, in its
holiday clothes. “Now,” said Adams, after they had gazed awhile, “here
be the keys,” therewithal casting towards them a huge bunch; but the
villains would now no more meddle with them than with so many aspics or
scorpions, looking on them in truth as the very keys of death’s door.
Accordingly, after venting a few curses on their ill luck, they began
to depart in very ill humour, when Adams again called to them to hear
his last words.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “though ye came hither with robbery, and perchance
murder in your hearts, against me, yet as a true Christian will I
not only forgive your wicked intents, but advise you how to shun
that miserable end which my own life is coming to so very suddenly.
Although your souls have been saved from sin, yet, doubtless ye have
not stood so long in this infected air without peril to the health of
your bodies, wherefore, by the advice of a dying man, go straightway
from this over to Laytonstone, where there be tan pits, and sit there
for a good hour amidst the strong smell of the tan, and which hath
more virtue as a remedy against the infection of the plague, than even
tobacco or the odour of drugs. Do this and live, for the poison is
strong and subtle, and seizeth, ere one can be aware, on the springs
of life.” Thereupon he uttered a dismal groan, and began yelling so
fearfully that the robbers with one accord took to flight, and never
stopped till they were come to Laytonstone, and into the tanner’s
very yard, where they sat down and stooped over the pit, snuffing up
the odours with all the relish of men in whose nostrils it was as the
breath of life. In which posture they had been sitting half an hour,
when there entered several persons with a lantern, and which they took
to be the tanner and his men, and to whom, therefore, they addressed
themselves, begging pardon for their boldness, and entreating leave to
continue awhile in the tan-yard to disinfect themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> of the plague;
but they had hardly uttered these words, when lo! each man was suddenly
seized upon, and bound in a twinkling, the constables, for such they
were, jeering them withal, and saying the plague had been too busy to
come itself, but had sent them a gallows and a halter instead, which
would serve their turn. Whereupon, most of the rogues became very
chop-fallen, but Blackface swore he could die easy but for one thing
upon his mind, and that was, what had become of the dead child and the
man dying of the plague, both of which he had seen with his own eyes.
Hereupon, the man with a lantern turned the light upon his own face,
which the rogues knew directly to be the countenance of Adams himself,
but without any of those black rings round the eyes, and for which
he explained he had been indebted to a little charcoal. “As for the
dead child,” he said, “you must enquire, my masters, of the worshipful
company of Barber Surgeons, and they will tell you of a certain waxen
puppet of Hygeia, the Goddess of Health, which used to be carried at
their pageants, and when it fell into disuse was purchased of them by
my Lady Dame Ellinor Wood, for a plaything to her own children. So one
head you see is worth four pair of hands, and your whole gang, tall,
and strong knaves though you be, have been overmatched by one old man
and a doll.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the Comic Annual.</i></p>

<p class="p0 mleft1">S<span class="smaller">IR</span>,</p>

<p>In one of your Annuals you have given insertion to “A Plan for
Writing Blank Verse in Rhyme;” but as I have seen no regular long
poem constructed on its principles, I suppose the scheme did not
take with the literary world. Under these circumstances I feel
encouraged to bring forward a novelty of my own, and I can only
regret that such poets as Chaucer and Cottle, Spenser and Hayley,
Milton and Pratt, Pope and Pye, Byron and Batterbee, should have
died before it was invented.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in verse is avowedly the rhyme. Dean
Swift says somewhere in his letters, “that a rhyme is as hard
to find with him as a guinea,”&mdash;and we all know that guineas
are proverbially scarce among poets. The merest versifier that
ever attempted a Valentine must have met with this Orson, some
untameable savage syllable that refused to chime in with society.
For instance, what poetical Foxhunter&mdash;a contributor to the
Sporting Magazine&mdash;has not drawn all the covers of Beynard Ceynard,
Deynard, Feynard, Geynard, Heynard, Keynard, Leynard, Meynard,
Neynard, Peynard, Queynard, to find a rhyme for Reynard? The spirit
of the times is decidedly against Tithe; and I know of no tithe
more oppressive than that poetical one, in heroic measure, which
requires that every tenth syllable shall pay a sound in kind. How
often the Poet goes up a line, only to be stopped at the end by
an impracticable rhyme, like a bull in a blind alley! I have an
ingenious medical friend, who might have been an eminent poet by
this time, but the first line he wrote ended in ipecacuanha, and
with all his physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> and mental power, he has never yet been able
to find a rhyme for it.</p>

<p>The plan I propose aims to obviate this hardship. My system is, to
take the bull by the horns; in short, to try at first what words
will chime, before you go farther, and fare worse. To say nothing
of other advantages, it will at least have one good effect,&mdash;and
that is, to correct the erroneous notion of the would-be poets and
poetesses of the present day, that the great <i>end</i> of poetry is
rhyme. I beg leave to present a specimen of worse, which proves
quite the reverse, and am, Sir,</p>

a kennel, and returns home dirty. He cares not for cards, yet strives
to be always with the pack. He loves fencing, but without carte or
tierce, and delights in a steeplechase, though he does not follow
the Church. He is anything but liti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>gious, yet is fond of a certain
suit, and retains Scarlet. He keeps a running account with Horse,
Dog, Fox, and Co., but objects to a check. As to cards, in choosing a
pack he prefers Hunt’s. In Theatricals, he favours Miss Somerville,
because her namesake wrote the Chase, though he never read it. He is
no great dancer, though he is fond of casting off twenty couple; and
no great Painter, though he draws covers, and seeks for a brush. He
is no Musician, and yet is fond of five bars. He despises Doctors,
yet follows a course of bark. He professes to love his country, but
is perpetually crossing it. He is fond of strong ale and beer, yet
dislikes any purl. He is good-tempered, yet so far a Tartar as to
prefer a saddle of Horse to a saddle of Mutton. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> is somewhat rough
and bearish himself, but insists on good breeding in horses and dogs.
He professes the Church Catechism, and countenances heathen dogmas, by
naming his hounds after Jupiter and Juno, Mars and Diana. He cares not
for violets, but he doats on a good scent. He says his wife is a shrew,
but objects to destroying a Vixen. In Politics he inclines to Pitt, and
runs after Fox. He is no milksop, but he loves to Tally. He protects
Poultry, and preserves Foxes. He follows but one business, and yet has
many pursuits. He pretends to be knowing, but a dog leads him by the
nose. He is as honest a fellow as need be, yet his neck is oftener
in danger than a thief’s. He swears he can clear anything, but is
beaten by a fog. He is no landlord of houses, but is particular about
fixtures. He studies “Summering the Hunter,” but goes Huntering in
the Winter. He esteems himself prosperous, and is always going to the
dogs. He delights in the Hunter’s Stakes, but takes care not to stake
his hunter. He praises discretion, but would rather let the cat out of
the bag than a fox. He does not shine at a human conversazione, but is
great among dogs giving tongue. To conclude, he runs as long as he can,
and then goes to earth, and his Heir is in at his death. But his Heir
does not stand in his shoes, for he never wore anything but boots.</p>

<p>T<span class="smaller">O</span> anticipate mistake, the above title refers not to Thomas Haynes&mdash;or
F. W. N.&mdash;or even any Publishers&mdash;but the original old Bailey. It
belongs to a set of Songs composed during the courtly leisure of what
is technically called a Juryman in Waiting&mdash;that is, one of a <i>corps
de reserve</i>, held in readiness to fill up the gaps which extraordinary
mental exertion&mdash;or sedentary habits&mdash;or starvation, may make in the
Council of Twelve. This wrong box it was once my fortune to get into.
On the 5th of November, at the 6th hour, leaving my bed, and the
luxurious perusal of Taylor on Early Rising&mdash;I walked from a yellow fog
into a black one, in my unwilling way to the New Court, which sweet
herbs even could not sweeten, for the sole purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> making criminals
uncomfortable. A neighbour, a retired sea Captain with a wooden leg,
now literally a jury-mast, limped with me from Highbury Terrace on the
same hanging errand&mdash;a personified Halter. Our legal drill Corporal
was Serjeant Arabin, and when our muster roll without butter was over,
before breakfast, the uninitiated can form no idea of the ludicrousness
of the excuses of the would-be Nonjurors,&mdash;aggravated by the solemnity
of a previous oath, the delivery from a witness-box like a pulpit, and
the professional gravity of the Court. One weakly old gentleman had
been ordered by his physician to eat little, but often, and apprehended
even fatal consequences from being locked up with an obstinate eleven;
another conscientious demurrer desired time to make himself master
of his duties, by consulting Jonathan Wild, Vidocq, Hardy Vaux, and
Lazarillo de Tormes. But the number of deaf men who objected the
hardness of their hearing criminal cases was beyond belief. The
Publishers of “Curtis on the Ear” and “Wright on the Ear”&mdash;(two popular
surgical works, though rather suggestive of Pugilism)&mdash;ought to have
stentorian agents in that Court. Defective on one side myself, I was
literally ashamed to strike up singly in such a chorus of muffled
double drums, and tacitly suffered my ears to be boxed with a common
Jury. I heard, on the right hand, a Judge’s charge&mdash;an arraignment
and evidence to match, with great dexterity, but failing to catch the
defence from the left hand, refused naturally to concur in any sinister
verdict. The learned Serjeant, I presume, as I was only half deaf,
only half discharged me,&mdash;committing me to the relay-box, as a juror
in Waiting,&mdash;and from which I was relieved only by his successor, Sir
Thomas Denman, and to justify my dulness, I made even his stupendous
voice to repeat my dismissal twice over!</p>

<p>It was during this compelled attendance that the project struck me
of a Series of Lays of Larceny, combining Sin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> Sentiment in that
melo-dramatic mixture which is so congenial to the cholera morbid
sensibility of the present age and stage. The following are merely
specimens, but a hint from the Powers that be&mdash;in the Strand,&mdash;will
promptly produce a handsome volume of the remainder, with a grateful
Dedication to the learned Serjeant.</p>

the old living Threap-Cum-Toddle. Little did I think to be ever
giving out the Psalms across the Atlantic, or to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> walking in the
streets of Barbadoes, surrounded by Blackamoors, big and little;
some crying after me, “There him go&mdash;look at Massa Amen!” Poor
African wretches! I do hope, by my Lord Bishop’s assistance, to
instruct many of them, and to teach them to have more respect for
ecclesiastic dignitaries.</p>

<p>Through a ludicrous clerical mischance, not fit for me to mention,
we have preached but once since our arrival. Oh! Jedidiah, how
different from the row of comely, sleek, and ruddy plain English
faces, that used to confront me in the Churchwarden’s pew, at the
old service in Hants,&mdash;Mr. Perryman’s clean, shining, bald head;
Mr. Truman’s respectable powdered, and Mr. Cutlet’s comely and
well-combed caxon!&mdash;Here, such a set of grinning sooty faces, that
if I had been in any other place, I might have fancied myself at a
meeting of Master Chimney-sweeps on May-Day. You know, Jedidiah,
how strange thoughts and things will haunt the mind, in spite of
one’s self, at times the least appropriate:&mdash;the line that follows
“The rose is red, the violet’s blue,” in the old Valentine, I am
ashamed to say, came across me I know not how often. Then after
service, no sitting on a tombstone for a cheerful bit of chat
with a neighbour&mdash;no invitation to dinner from the worshipful
Churchwardens. The jabber of these Niggers is so outlandish or
unintelligible, I can hardly say I am on speaking terms with any
of our parishioners, except Mr. Pompey, the Governor’s black,
whose trips to England have made his English not quite so full of
Greek as the others. There is one thing, however, that is so great
a disappointment of my hopes and enjoyments, that I think, if I
had foreseen it, I should not have come out even at the Bishop’s
request. The song in the play-book says, you know, “While all
Barbadoes bells do ring!”&mdash;but alas, Jedidiah, there is not a
ring of bells in the whole island!&mdash;You who remember my fondness
for that melodious pastime, indeed I may say my passion, for a
Grandsire Peel of Triple Bob-Majors truly pulled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> and the changes
called by myself, as when I belonged to the Great Tom Society of
Hampshire Youths,&mdash;may conceive my regret that, instead of coming
here, I did not go out to Swan River&mdash;I am told they have a Peel
there.</p>

<p class="s5 center">“Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the
plain.”&mdash;G<span class="smaller">OLDSMITH</span>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I H<span class="smaller">AVE</span> a great anxiety to become a topographer, and I do not know that
I can make an easier commencement of the character, than by attempting
a description of our village. It will be found, as my friend the
landlord over the way says, that “things are drawn <i>mild</i>.”</p>

<p>I live opposite the Green Man. I know that to be the sign, in spite of
the picture, because I am told of the fact in large gilt letters, in
three several places. The whole-length portrait of “<i>l’homme verd</i>” is
rather imposing. He stands plump before you, in a sort of wrestling
attitude, the legs standing distinctly apart, in a brace of decided
boots, with dun tops, joined to a pair of creole-coloured leather
breeches. The rest of his dress is peculiar; the coat, a two-flapper,
green and brown, or, as they say at the tap, <i>half-and-half</i>; a cocked
hat on the half cock; a short belt crossing the breast like a flat
gas-pipe. The one hand stuck on the greeny-brown hip of my friend, in
the other a gun with a barrel like an entire butt, and a butt like a
brewer’s whole stock. On one side, looking up at the vanished visage of
his master, is all that remains of a liver-and-white pointer&mdash;seeming
now to be some old dog from India, for his white complexion is turned
yellow, and his liver is more than half gone!</p>

<p>The inn is really a very quiet, cozy, comfortable inn, though the
landlord announces a fact in larger letters, methinks, than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
information warrants, viz., that he is “<i>Licensed to deal in Foreign
Wines and Spirits</i>.” All innkeepers, I trust, are so licensed; there is
no occasion to make so brazen a brag of this sinecure permit.</p>

<p>I had written thus far, when the tarnished gold letters of the Green
Man seemed to be suddenly re-gilt; and on looking upwards, I perceived
that a sort of sky-light had been opened in the clouds, giving entrance
to a bright gleam of sunshine, which glowed with remarkable effect on
a yellow post-chaise in the stable-yard, and brought the ducks out
beautifully white from the black horse-pond. Tempted by the appearance
of the weather, I put down my pen and strolled out for a quarter of
an hour before dinner to inhale that air, without which, like the
chameleon I cannot feed. On my return, I found, with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> surprise,
that my papers were a good deal discomposed; but, before I had time
for much wonder, my landlady entered with one of her most obliging
courtesies, and observed that she had seen me writing in the morning,
and it had occurred to her by chance, that I might by possibility
have been writing a description of the village. I told her that I had
actually been engaged on that very subject. “If that is the case, of
course, Sir, you would begin, no doubt, about the Green Man, being
so close by; and I dare say, you would say something about the sign,
and the Green Man with his top boots, and his gun, and his Indian
liver-and-white pointer, though his white to be sure is turned yellow,
and his liver is more than half gone.” “You are perfectly right, Mrs.
Ledger,” I replied, “and in one part of the description, I think I
have used almost your own very words.” “Well, that <i>is</i> curious, Sir,”
exclaimed Mrs. L., and physically, not arithmetically, casting up
all her hands and eyes. “Moreover, what I mean to say, is this; and
I only say that to save trouble. There’s a young man lodges at the
Green Grocer’s over the way, who has writ an account of the village
already to your hand. The people about the place call him the Poet,
but, anyhow, he studies a good deal, and writes beautiful; and, as I
said before, has made the whole village out of his own head. Now, it
might save trouble, Sir, if you was to write it out, and I am sure I
have a copy, that, as far as the loan goes, is at your service, Sir.”
My curiosity induced me to take the offer; and as the poem really
forestalled what I had to say of the Hamlet, I took my landlady’s
advice and transcribed it,&mdash;and here it is.</p>

    <div class="verse">And in the middle, there’s a green of about not exceeding an acre and a half;</div>
    <div class="verse">It’s common to all, and fed off by nineteen cows, six ponies, three horses, five asses, two foals, seven pigs, and a calf!</div>
    <div class="verse">Besides a pond in the middle, as is held by a similar sort of common law lease,</div>
    <div class="verse">And contains twenty ducks, six drakes, three ganders, two dead dogs, four drown’d kittens, and twelve geese.</div>
    <div class="verse">Of course the green’s cropt very close, and does famous for bowling when the little village boys play at cricket;</div>
    <div class="verse">Only some horse, or pig, or cow, or great jackass is sure to come and stand right before the wicket.</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s fifty-five private houses, let alone barns and workshops, and pig-sties, and poultry huts, and such-like sheds;</div>
    <div class="verse">With plenty of public-houses&mdash;two Foxes, one Green Man, three Bunch of Grapes, one Crown, and six King’s Heads.</div>
    <div class="verse">The Green Man is reckon’d the best, as the only one that for love or money can raise</div>
    <div class="verse">A postillion, a blue jacket, two deplorable lame white horses, and a ramshackled “neat post-chaise.”</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s one parish church for all the people, whatsoever may be their ranks in life or their degrees,</div>
    <div class="verse">Except one very damp, small, dark, freezing-cold, little Methodist chapel of Ease;</div>
    <div class="verse">And close by the church-yard, there’s a stone-mason’s yard, that when the time is seasonable</div>
    <div class="verse">Will furnish with afflictions sore and marble urns and cherubims very low and reasonable.</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s a cage, comfortable enough; I’ve been in it with Old Jack Jeffrey and Tom Pike;</div>
    <div class="verse">For the Green Man next door will send you in ale, gin, or any thing else you like.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">I can’t speak of the stocks, as nothing remains of them but the upright post;</div>
    <div class="verse">But the pound is kept in repairs for the sake of Cob’s horse, as is always there almost.</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s a smithy of course, where that queer sort of a chap in his way, Old Joe Bradley,</div>
    <div class="verse">Perpetually hammers and stammers, for he stutters and shoes horses very badly.</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s a shop of all sorts, that sells every thing, kept by the widow of Mr. Task;</div>

    <div class="verse">You’ll know her house by the swarm of boys, like flies, about the old sugary cask.</div>
    <div class="verse">There are six empty houses, and not so well paper’d inside as out,</div>
    <div class="verse">For bill-stickers won’t beware, but sticks notices of sales and election placards all about.</div>
    <div class="verse">That’s the Doctor’s with a green door, where the garden pots in the windows is seen;</div>
    <div class="verse">A weakly monthly rose that don’t blow, and a dead geranium, and a tea-plant with five black leaves and one green.</div>

    <div class="verse">But the Tailor’s front garden grow two cabbages, a dock, a ha’porth of pennyroyal, two dandelions, and a thistle.</div>
    <div class="verse">There are three small orchards&mdash;Mr. Busby’s the schoolmaster’s is the chief&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">With two pear-trees that don’t bear; one plum and an apple, that every year is stripped by a thief.</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s another small day-school too, kept by the respectable Mrs. Gaby;</div>
    <div class="verse">A select establishment, for six little boys and one big, and four little girls and a baby.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
    <div class="verse">There’s a rectory, with pointed gables and strange odd chimneys that never smokes,</div>
    <div class="verse">For the rector don’t live on his living like other Christian sort of folks;</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s a barber’s, once a-week well filled with rough black-bearded shock-headed churls,</div>
    <div class="verse">And a window with two feminine men’s heads, and two masculine ladies in false curls;</div>
    <div class="verse">There’s a butcher’s and a carpenter’s and a plumber’s and a small green-grocer’s, and a baker,</div>
    <div class="verse">But he won’t bake on a Sunday, and there’s a sexton that’s a coal-merchant besides, and an undertaker;</div>
    <div class="verse">And a toy-shop, but not a whole one, for a village can’t compare with the London shops;</div>
    <div class="verse">One window sells drums, dolls, kites, carts, bats, Clout’s balls, and the other sells malt and hops.</div>
    <div class="verse">And Mrs. Brown, in domestic economy not to be a bit behind her betters,</div>
    <div class="verse">Lets her house to a milliner, a watchmaker, a rat-catcher, a cobbler, lives in it herself, and it’s the post-office for letters.</div>
    <div class="verse">Now I’ve gone through all the village&mdash;ay, from end to end, save and except one more house,</div>
    <div class="verse">But I haven’t come to that&mdash;and I hope I never shall&mdash;and that’s the Village Poor-House!</div>

<p>S<span class="smaller">OME</span> men seem born to be lucky. Happier than kings, Fortune’s wheel
has for them no revolutions. Whatever they touch turns to gold,&mdash;their
path is paved with the philosopher’s stone. At games of chance they
have no chance; but what is better, a certainty. They hold four suits
of trumps. They get windfalls, without a breath stirring&mdash;as legacies.
Prizes turn up for them in lotteries. On the turf, their horse&mdash;an
outsider&mdash;always wins. They enjoy a whole season of benefits. At the
very worst, in trying to drown themselves, they dive on some treasure
undiscovered since the Spanish Armada; or tie their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> halter to a hook,
that unseals a hoard in the ceiling. That’s their luck.</p>

<p>There is another kind of fortune, called ill-luck; so ill, that you
hope it will die;&mdash;but it don’t. That’s my luck.</p>

<p>Other people keep scrap-books; but I, a scrape-book. It is theirs to
insert bon-mots, riddles, anecdotes, caricatures, facetiæ of all kinds;
mine to record mischances, failures, accidents, disappointments; in
short, as the betters say, I have always a bad book. Witness a few
extracts, bitter as extract of bark.</p>

<p>April 1st. Married on this day: in the first week of the honeymoon,
stumbled over my father-in-law’s beehives! He has 252 bees; thanks
to me, he is now able to check them. Some of the insects having an
account against me, preferred to <i>settle</i> on my calf. Others swarmed
on my hands. My bald head seemed a perfect humming-top! Two hundred
and fifty-two stings&mdash;it should be “stings&mdash;and arrows of outrageous
fortune!” But that’s my luck. Rushed bee-blind into the horse-pond,
and <i>torn out</i> by Tiger, the house dog. Staggered incontinent into
the pig-sty, and collared by the sow&mdash;sus. per coll. for kicking her
sucklings; recommended oil for my wounds, and none but lamp ditto in
the house; relieved of the stings at last&mdash;what luck! by 252 operations.</p>

<p>9th. Gave my adored Belinda a black eye, in the open street, aiming at
a lad who attempted to snatch her reticule. Belinda’s part taken by a
big rascal, as deaf as a post, who wanted to fight me “for striking a
woman.” My luck again.</p>

<p>12th. Purchased a mare, warranted so gentle that a lady might ride
her, and, indeed, no animal could be quieter, except the leather one,
formerly in the Show-room, at Exeter Change. Meant for the first time
to ride with Belinda to the Park&mdash;put my foot in the stirrup, and found
myself on my own back instead of the mare’s. Other men are thrown by
their horses, but a saddle does it for me. Well, nothing is so hard as
my luck&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>unless it be the fourth flag or stone from the post at the
north corner of Harley Street.</p>

<p>14th. Run down in a wherry by a coal-brig, off Greenwich, but
providentially picked up by a steamer, that burst her boiler directly
afterwards. Saved to be scalded!&mdash;But misfortunes with me never came
single, from my very childhood. I remember when my little brothers and
sisters tumbled down stairs, they always hitched halfway at the angle.
<i>My</i> luck invariably turned the corner. It could not bear to bate me a
single bump.</p>

<p>17th. Had my eye picked out by a pavior who was <i>axing</i> his way, he
didn’t care where. Sent home in a hackney chariot that upset. Paid
Jarvis a sovereign for a shilling. My luck all over!</p>

<p>1st of May. My flue on fire. Not a sweep to be had for love or
money!&mdash;Lucky enough <i>for me</i>&mdash;the parish engine soon arrived, with
all the charity school. Boys are fond of playing&mdash;and indulged their
propensity by playing into my best drawing-room. Every friend I had
dropped in to dinner. Nothing but Lacedemonian black broth. Others have
pot-luck, but I have not even pint-luck&mdash;at least of the right sort.</p>

<p>8th. Found, on getting up, that the kitchen garden had been stripped by
thieves, but had the luck at night to catch some one in the garden, by
walking into my own trap. Afraid to call out, for fear of being shot at
by the gardener, who would have hit me to a dead certainty&mdash;for such is
my luck!</p>

<p>10th. Agricultural distress is a treat to mine. My old friend Bill&mdash;I
must henceforth call him Corn-bill&mdash;has, this morning, laid his
unfeeling wooden leg on my tenderest toe, like a thresher. In spite of
Dibdin, I don’t believe that oak has any heart; or it would not be such
a walking tread-mill!</p>

<p>12th. Two pieces of “my usual.” First knocked down by a mad bull.
Secondly, picked up by a pick-pocket. Anybody but me would have found
one honest humane man out of a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> crowd; but I am born to suffer,
whether done by accident or done by design. Luckily for me and the
pick-pocket, I was able to identify him, bound over to prosecute,
and had the satisfaction of exporting him to Botany Bay. I suppose I
performed well in a court of justice, for the next day&mdash;“<i>Encore un
coup</i>!”&mdash;I had a summons to serve with a Middlesex jury, at the Old
Bailey, for a fortnight.</p>

<p>14th. My number in the lottery has come up a capital prize. Luck at
last&mdash;if I had not lost the ticket.</p>

AN UNDERTAKER.</h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smaller">O</span> mention only by name the sorrows of an Undertaker, will be likely to
raise a smile on most faces,&mdash;the mere words suggest a solemn stalking
parody of grief to the satiric fancy;&mdash;but give a fair hearing to my
woes, and even the veriest mocker may learn to pity an Undertaker who
has been unfortunate in all his undertakings.</p>

<p>My Father, a Furnisher and Performer in the funeral line, used to say
of me,&mdash;noticing some boyish levities&mdash;that “I should never do for an
Undertaker.” But the prediction was wrong&mdash;my Parent died, and I did
for him in the way of business. Having no other alternative, I took
possession of a very fair stock and business. I felt at first as if
plunged in the Black Sea&mdash;and when I read my name upon the shop door,
it threw a crape over my spirits, that I did not get rid of for some
months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the cares of business. The scandalous insinuated that the
funerals were not so decorously performed as in the time of the Late. I
discharged my mutes, who were grown fat and jocular, and sought about
for the lean and lank visaged kind. But these demure rogues cheated and
robbed me&mdash;plucked my feathers and pruned my scarfs, and I was driven
back again to my “merrie men,”&mdash;whose only fault was making a pleasure
of their business.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">FAIRY LAND.</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after this, I made myself prominent in the parish, and obtained
a contract for Parochial Conchology&mdash;or shells for the paupers. But
this even, as I may say, broke down on its first tressels. Having as my
first job to inter a workhouse female&mdash;Ætat. 96&mdash;and wishing to gain
the good opinion of the parish, I had made the arrangements with more
than usual decency. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> company were at the door. Placing myself at
the head, with my best burial face, and my slowest solemnity of step,
I set forward, and thanks to my professional deafness,&mdash;induced by
the constant hammering&mdash;I never perceived, till at the church gates,
that the procession had not stirred from the door of the house. So
good a joke was not lost upon my two Mutes, who made it an excuse for
chuckling on after occasions. But to me the consequence was serious.
A notion arose amongst the poor that I was too proud to walk along
with their remains, and the ferment ran so high, that I was finally
compelled to give up my contract.</p>

<p>So much for foot funerals. Now for coach work. The extravagant charges
of the jobbers at last induced me to set up a Hearse and Mourning
Coaches of my own, with sleek ebony long-tailed horses to match. One
of these&mdash;the finest of the set&mdash;had been sold to me under warranty of
being sound and free from vice; and so he was, but the dealer never
told me that he had been a charger at Astley’s. Accordingly on his
very first performance, in passing through Bow,&mdash;at that time a kind
of Fairy Land,&mdash;he thought proper, on hearing a showman’s trumpet, to
dance a cotillion in his feathers! There was nothing to be done but to
travel on with three to the next stage, where I sold the caperer at a
heavy loss, and to the infinite regret of my merry mourners, with whom
this exhibition had made him a great favourite. From this period my
business rapidly declined, till instead of five or six demises, on an
average, I put in only two defuncts and a half per week.</p>

<p>In this extremity a “black job” was brought to me that promised to make
amends for the rest. One fine morning a brace of executors walked into
the shop, and handing to me the following extract of a will, politely
requested that I would perform accordingly&mdash;and with the pleasing
addition that I was to be regardless of the expense. The document ran
thus: “Item, I will and desire that after death, my body be placed in
a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> leaden coffin, the same to be afterwards enclosed in one of
oak, and therein my remains to be conveyed handsomely to the village
of *** in Norfolk, my birth-place; there to lie, being duly watched,
during one night, in the Family mansion now unoccupied, and on the
morrow to be carried thence to the church, the coffin being borne by
the six oldest resident and decayed parishioners, male or female, and
for the same they shall receive severally the sum of five pounds, to be
paid on or before the day of interment.”</p>

<p>It will be believed that I lost no time in preparing the last solid
and costly receptacles for the late Lady Lambert; and the unusual
bulk of the deceased seemed in prospective to justify a bill of
proportionate magnitude. I was prodigal of plumes and scutcheons, of
staves and scarfs, and mourning coaches; and finally, raising a whole
company of black cavalry, we set out by stages, short and sweet, for
our destination. I had been prudent enough to send a letter before me
to prepare the bearers, and imprudent enough to remit their fees in
advance. But I had no misgivings. My men enjoyed the excursion, and so
did I. We ate well, drank well, slept well, and expected to be well
paid for what was so well done. At the last stage it happened I had
rather an intricate reckoning to arrange, by which means being detained
a full hour behind the cavalcade, I did not reach the desired village
till the whole party had established themselves at the Dying Dolphin;
a fact I first ascertained from hearing the merriment of my two mutes
in the parlour. Highly indignant at this breach of decorum, I rushed
in on the offending couple; and let the Undertaking Reader conceive my
feelings, when the following letter was put into my hands, explaining
at once the good joke of the two fellows, or rather, that of the whole
village.</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;We have sought out the six oldest of the pauper parishioners of
this place, namely as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

  <li>Barbara Copp, 94 years, born without arms.</li>
  <li>Philip Gill, about 81, an Idiot.</li>
  <li>Mary Ridges, 79, afflicted with St. Vitus.</li>

and for which they are very grateful.</p>

<p>Such were the six bearers who were to carry Lady Lambert to the church,
and who could as soon have carried the church to Lady Lambert. To crown
all, I rashly listened to the advice of my thoughtless mutes, and in an
evil hour deposited the body without troubling any parishioner, old or
young, on the subject. The consequence is, the Executors demur to my
bill, because I have not acted up to the letter of my instructions. I
have had to stand treat for a large party on the road, to sustain all
the charges of the black cavalry, and am besides minus thirty pounds in
charity, without even the merit of a charitable intention!</p>

mouth all-agape in the ludicrous expectation of seeing the Lord Mayor
standing on his very Worshipful head, the Lady Mayoress lifting
a hundred weight by her Right Honourable hair, the Sword-Bearer
swallowing his blade of state, the Recorder conjuring ribands from his
learned and eloquent mouth, and the Senior Alderman with a painted
York-and-Lancaster-face, dancing a <i>saraband</i> à la Pierrot! Or fancy
Jolterhead at the fair of the Surrey Zoological, forcing his clumsy
destructive course through groups of female fashionables, like a hog in
a tulip bed, with the equally laughable intention of inspecting long
horns and short horns, prime beasts and lean stock, of handling the
porkers and coughing the colts. Nay, imagine our bumpkin at the great

<p>P<span class="smaller">OETRY</span> and poverty begin with the same letter, and in more respects
than one, are “as like each other as two P’s.”&mdash;Nine tailors are
the making of a man, but not so the nine Muses. Their votaries are
notoriously only water drinkers, eating mutton cold, and dwelling in
attics. Look at the miserable lives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> deaths recorded of the poets.
“Butler,” says Mr. D’Israeli, “lived in a cellar, and Goldsmith in
a Deserted Village. Savage ran wild,&mdash;Chatterton was carried on St.
Augustine’s Back like a young gipsy; and his half-starved <i>Rowley</i>
always said Heigho, when he heard of gammon and spinach. Gray’s day’s
were ode-ious, and Gay’s gaiety was fabulous. Falconer was shipwrecked.
Homer was a blind beggar, and Pope raised a subscription for him, and
went snacks. Crabbe found himself in the poor-house, Spenser couldn’t
afford a great-coat, and Milton was led up and down by his daughters to
save the expense of a dog.”</p>

<p>It seems all but impossible to be a poet, in easy circumstances.
Pope has shown how verses are written by Ladies of Quality&mdash;and what
execrable rhymes Sir Richard Blackmore composed in his chariot; in a
hay-cart he might have sung like a Burns.</p>

<p>As the editors of magazines and annuals (save one) well know, the truly
poetical contributions which can be inserted, are not those which
come post free, in rose-coloured tinted paper, scented with musk, and
sealed with fancy wax. The real article arrives by post, unpaid, sealed
with rosin, or possibly with a dab of pitch or cobbler’s wax, bearing
the impression of a halfpenny, or more frequently of a button,&mdash;the
paper is dingy, and scant&mdash;the hand-writing has evidently come to
the author by nature&mdash;there are trips in the spelling, and Priscian
is a little scratch’d or so&mdash;but a rill of the true Castalian runs
through the whole composition, though its fountain-head was a broken
tea-cup, instead of a silver standish. A few years ago I used to be
favoured with numerous poems for insertion, which bore the signature
of Fitz-Norman; the crest on the seal had probably descended from the
Conquest, and the packets were invariably delivered by a Patagonian
footman in green and gold. The author was evidently rich, and the
verses were as palpably poor; they were declined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> with the usual
answer to correspondents who do not answer, and the communications
ceased&mdash;as I thought for ever, but I was deceived; a few days back one
of the dirtiest and raggedest of street urchins delivered a soiled
whity brown packet, closed with a wafer, which bore the impress of a
thimble. The paper had more the odour of tobacco than of rose leaves,
and the writing appeared to have been perpetrated with a skewer dipped
in coffee-grounds; but the old signature of Fitz-Norman had the honour
to be my “very humble servant” at the foot of the letter. It was
too certain that he had fallen from affluence to indigence, but the
adversity which had wrought such a change upon the writing implements,
had, as usual, improved his poetry. The neat crowquill never traced on
the superfine Bath paper any thing so unaffected as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="s5 center">“This, this, is solitude.”&mdash;L<span class="smaller">ORD</span>
B<span class="smaller">YRON</span>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I <span class="smaller">WAS</span> born, I may almost say, an orphan; my Father died three months
before I saw the light, and my Mother three hours after&mdash;thus I was
left in the whole world alone, and an only child, for I had neither
Brothers nor Sisters; much of my after passion for solitude might be
ascribed to this cause, for I believe our tendencies date themselves
from a much earlier age, or rather, youth, than is generally imagined.
It was remarked that I could go alone at nine months, and I have had
an aptitude to going alone all the rest of my life. The first words
I learnt to say, were “I by myself, I”&mdash;or thou&mdash;or he&mdash;or she&mdash;or
it&mdash;but I was a long time before I could pronounce any personals in the
plural; my little games and habits were equally singular. I was fond of
playing at Solitary or at Patience, or another game of cards of my own
invention, namely, whist, with <i>three</i> dummies. Of books, my favourite
was Robinson Crusoe, especially the first part, for I was not fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> of
the intrusion of Friday, and thought the natives really were Savages
to spoil such a solitude. At ten years of age I was happily placed
with the Rev. Mr. Steinkopff, a widower, who took in only the limited
number of six pupils, and had only me to begin with; here I enjoyed
myself very much, learning in a first and last class in school hours,
and playing in play time at hoop, and other pretty games not requiring
partners. My playground was, in short, a garden of Eden, and I did not
even sigh for an Eve, but, like Paradise, it was too happy to last.
I was removed from Mr. Steinkopff’s to the University of Göttingen,
and at once the eyes of six hundred pupils, and the pupils of twelve
hundred eyes, seemed fastened upon me: I felt like an owl forced into
day-light; often and often I shammed ill, as an excuse for confining
myself to my chamber, but some officious would-be friends, insisting
on coming to sit with me, as they said, to enliven my solitude, I
was forced as a last resource to do that which subjected me, on the
principle of Howard’s Prison Discipline, to solitary confinement.
But even this pleasure did not last; the heads of the College found
out that solitary confinement was no punishment, and put another
student in the same cell; in this extremity I had no alternative but
to endeavour to make him a convert to my principles, and in some days
I succeeded in convincing him of the individual independence of man,
the solid pleasures of solitude, and the hollow one of society,&mdash;in
short, he so warmly adopted my views, that in a transport of sympathy
we swore an eternal friendship, and agreed to separate for ever,
and keep ourselves to ourselves as much as possible. To this end we
formed with our blanket a screen across our cell, and that we might
not even in thought associate with each other, he soliloquised only
in French, of which I was ignorant, and I in English, to which he was
equally a stranger. Under this system my wishes were gratified, for
I think I felt more intensely lonely than I ever remember when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> more
strictly alone. Of course this condition had a conclusion; we were
brought out again unwillingly into the common world, and the firm
of Zimmermann, Nobody, and Co., was compelled to admit&mdash;six hundred
partners. In this extremity, my fellow prisoner Zingleman and myself
had recourse to the persuasions of oratory. We preached solitude, and
got quite a congregation, and of the six hundred hearers, four hundred
at least became converts to our Unitarian Doctrine; every one of these
disciples strove to fly to the most obscure recesses, and the little
cemetery of the College had always a plenty of those who were trying
to make themselves scarce. This of course was afflicting; as in the
game of puss in a corner, it was difficult to get a corner unoccupied
to be alone in; the defections and desertions from the College were
consequently numerous, and for a long time the state gazette contained
daily advertisements for missing gentlemen, with a description of their
persons and habits, and invariably concluding with this sentence: “of a
melancholy turn,&mdash;calls himself a Zimmermanian, and affects solitude.”
In fact, as Schiller’s Robbers begot Robbers, so did my solitude
beget solitudinarians, but with this difference, that the dramatist’s
disciples frequented the Highways, and mine the Byeways!</p>

<p>The consequence was what might have been expected, which I had
foreseen, and ardently desired. I was expelled from the University of
Göttingen. This was perhaps the triumph of my life. A grand dinner was
got up by Zingleman in my honour, at which more than three hundred
were present, but in tacit homage to my principles, they never spoke
nor held any communication with each other, and at a concerted signal
the toast of “Zimmermann and Solitude” was drunk, by dumb show, in
appropriate solemn silence. I was much affected by this tribute, and
left with tears in my eyes, to think, with such sentiments, how many of
us might be thrown together again. Being thus left to myself, like a
vessel with only one hand on board, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> at liberty to steer my own
course, and accordingly took a lodging at Number One, in Wilderness
Street, that held out the inviting prospect of a single room to let for
a single man. In this congenial situation I composed that my great work
on Solitude, and here I think it necessary to warn the reader against
many spurious books, calling themselves “Companions to Zimmermann’s
Solitude,” as if solitude could have society. Alas, from this work I
may date the decline which my presentiment tells me will terminate
in my death. My book, though written against populousness, became so
popular, that its author, though in love with loneliness, could never
be alone. Striving to fly from the face of man, I could never escape
it, nor that of woman and child into the bargain. When I stirred
abroad mobs surrounded me, and cried, “Here is the Solitary!”&mdash;when
I staid at home I was equally crowded; all the public societies of
Göttingen thought proper to come up to me with addresses, and not even
by deputation. Flight was my only resource, but it did not avail, for
I could not fly from myself. Wherever I went Zimmermann and Solitude
had got before me, and their votaries assembled to meet me. In vain
I travelled throughout the European and Asiatic continent: with an
enthusiasm and perseverance of which only Germans are capable, some of
my countrymen were sure to haunt me, and really showed by the distance
they journeyed, that they were ready to go all lengths with me and my
doctrine. Some of these Pilgrims even brought their wives and children
along with them, in search of my solitude; and were so unreasonable
even as to murmur at my taking the inside of a coach, or the cabin of a
packet-boat to myself.</p>

<p>From these persecutions I was released by what some persons would call
an unfortunate accident, a vessel in which I sailed from Leghorn, going
down at sea with all hands excepting my own pair, which happened to
have grappled a hen-coop. There was no sail in sight, nor any land to
be seen&mdash;nothing but sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> and sky; and from the midst of the watery
expanse it was perhaps the first and only glimpse I ever had of real
and perfect solitude, yet so inconsistent is human nature, I could
not really and perfectly enter into its enjoyment. I was picked up
at length by a British brig of war, and, schooled by the past, had
the presence of mind to conceal my name, and to adopt the English one
of Grundy. Under this <i>nom de guerre</i>, but really a name of peace,
I enjoyed comparative quiet, interrupted only by the pertinacious
attendance of an unconscious countryman, who, noticing my very retired
habits, endeavoured by daily lectures from my own work, to make me
a convert to my own principles. In short, he so wore me out, that
at last, to get rid of his importunities, I told him in confidence
that I was the author himself. But the result was anything but what I
expected; and here I must blush again for the inconsistency of human
nature. While Winkells knew me only as Grundy, he painted nothing but
the charms of Solitude, and exhorted me to detach myself from society;
but no sooner did he learn that I was Zimmermann, than he insisted on
my going to Lady C&mdash;&mdash;’s rout and his own conversazione. In fact,
he wanted to make me, instead of a Lion of the Desert, a Lion of the
Menagerie. How I resented such a proposition may be supposed, as
well as his offer to procure for me the first vacancy that happened
in the situation of Hermit at Lord P&mdash;&mdash;’s Hermitage; being, as he
was pleased to say, not only able to bear solitude, but well-bred
and well-informed, and fit to <i>receive company</i>. The effect of this
unfortunate disclosure was to make me leave England, for fear of
meeting with the fate of a man or an ox that ventures to quit the
common herd. I should immediately have been declared mad, and mobbed
into lunacy, and then put into solitary confinement, with a keeper
always with me, as a person beside himself, and not fit to be left
alone for a moment. As such a fate would have been worse to me than
death, I immediately left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> London, and am now living anonymously in an
uninhabited house,&mdash;prudence forbids me to say where.</p>

<span class="s6">BEING AN APOLOGY FOR NOT MAKING AN ATTEMPT ON MY
OWN LIFE.</span></h2>

</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smaller">HE</span> late inimitable Charles Mathews, in one of his amusing
entertainments, used to tell a story of a certain innkeeper, who made
it a rule of his house, to allow a candle to a guest, only on condition
of his ordering a pint of wine. Whereupon the guest contends, on the
reciprocity system, for a light for every half-bottle, and finally
drinks himself into a general illumination.</p>

<p>Something of the above principle seems to have obtained in the case of
a Portrait and a Memoir, which in literary practice have been usually
dependent on each other&mdash;a likeness and a life,&mdash;a candle and a pint of
wine. The mere act of sitting, probably suggests the idea of hatching;
at least an author has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> seldom nestled in a painter’s chair, without
coming out afterwards with a brood of Reminiscences, and accordingly,
no sooner was my effigy about to be presented to the Public, than I
found myself called upon by my Publisher, with a finished proof of the
engraving in one hand, and a request for an account of myself in the
other. He evidently supposed, as a matter of course, that I had my
autobiography in the bottle, and that the time was come to uncork and
pour it out <i>with a Head</i>.</p>

<p>To be candid, no portrait, perhaps, ever stood more in need of such an
accompaniment. The figure opposite has certainly the look of one of
those practical jokes whereof the original is oftener suspected than
really culpable. It might pass for the sign of “The Grave Maurice.” The
author of Elia has declared that he once sat as substitute for a whole
series of British Admirals,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and a physiognomist might reasonably
suspect that in wantonness or weariness, instead of giving my head I
had procured myself to be painted by proxy. For who, that calls himself
stranger, could ever suppose that such a pale, pensive, peaking,
sentimental, sonneteering countenance&mdash;with a wry mouth as if it always
laughed on its wrong side&mdash;belonged bonâ fide to the Editor of the
Comic&mdash;a Professor of the Pantagruelian Philosophy, hinted at in the
preface to the present work? What unknown who reckons himself decidedly
serious, would recognise the head and front of my “offending,” in a
visage not at all too hilarious for a frontispiece to the Evangelical
Magazine! In point of fact the owner has been taken sundry times, ere
now, for a Methodist Minister, and a pious turn has been attributed
to his hair&mdash;lucus a non lucendo&mdash;from its having no turn in it at
all.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In like manner my literary contemporaries who have cared to
remark on my personals, have agreed in ascribing to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> a melancholy
bias; thus an authority in the New Monthly Magazine has described me
as “a grave anti-pun-like-looking person,” whilst another&mdash;in the Book
of Gems&mdash;declares that “my countenance is more grave than merry,” and
insists, therefore, that I am of a pensive habit, and “have never
laughed heartily in company or in rhyme.” Against such an inference,
however, I solemnly protest, and if it be the fault of my features,
I do not mind telling my face to its face that it insinuates a false
Hood, and grossly misrepresents a person notorious amongst friends
for laughing at strange times and odd places, and in particular when
he has the worst of the rubber. For it is no comfort for the loss of
points, by his theory, to be upon thorns. And truly what can be more
unphilosophical, than to sit ruefully as well as whistfully, with your
face inconsistently playing at longs and your hand at shorts,&mdash;getting
hypped as well as pipped,&mdash;“talking of Hoyle,” as the City lady said,
“but looking like winegar,” and betraying as keen a sense of the profit
and loss, as if the <i>pack</i> had turned you into a <i>pedlar</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>But I am digressing; and turning my back, as Lord Castlereagh would
have said, on my face. The portrait, then, is genuine&mdash;“an ill-favoured
thing, Sir,” as Touchstone says, “but mine own.” For its quarrel with
the rules of Lavater there is precedent. I remember seeing on Sir
Thomas Lawrence’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> easel, an unfinished head of Mr. Wilberforce, so
very merry, so rosy, so good-fellowish, that nothing less than the Life
and Correspondence recently published could have persuaded me that
he was really a serious character. A memoir, therefore, would be the
likeliest thing to convince the world that the physiognomy prefixed
to this number is actually Hood’s Own:&mdash;indeed a few of the earlier
chapters would suffice to clear up the mystery, by proving that my face
is only answering in the affirmative, the friendly enquiry of the Poet
of all circles&mdash;“Has sorrow thy young days shaded?”&mdash;and telling the
honest truth of one of those rickety constitutions which, according to
Hudibras, seem</p>

<div class="poetry-container s5">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“&mdash;&mdash; as if intended</div>
    <div class="verse">For nothing else but to be mended.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="mtop1">To confess the truth, my vanity pricked up its ears a little at the
proposition of my Publisher. There is something vastly flattering in
the idea of appropriating the half or quarter of a century, mixing it
up with your personal experience, and then serving it out as your own
Life and Times. On casting a retrospective glance, however, across
Memory’s waste, it appeared so literally a waste that vanity herself
shrank from the enclosure act, as an unpromising speculation. Had I
foreseen, indeed, some five-and-thirty years ago, that such a demand
would be made upon me, I might have laid myself out on purpose, as
Dr. Watts recommends, so as “to give of every day some good account
at last.” I would have lived like a Frenchman, for effect, and made
my life a long dress rehearsal of the future biography. I would have
cultivated incidents “pour servir,” laid traps for adventures, and
illustrated my memory like Rogers’s, by a brilliant series of Tableaux.
The earlier of My Seven Stages should have been more Wonder Phenomenon
Comet and Balloon-like, and have been timed to a more Quicksilver
pace than they have travelled; in short, my Life, according to the
tradesman’s promise, should have been “fully equal to bespoke.” But
alas! in the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span> of such a Scottish second-sight, my whole course
of existence up to the present moment would hardly furnish materials
for one of those “bald biographies” that content the old gentlemanly
pages of Sylvanus Urban. Lamb, on being applied to for a Memoir of
himself, made answer that it would go into an epigram; and I really
believe that I could compress my own into that baker’s dozen of lines
called a sonnet. Montgomery, indeed, has forestalled the greater part
of it, in his striking poem on the “Common Lot,” but in prose, nobody
could ever make anything of it, except Mr. George Robins. The lives of
literary men are proverbially barren of interest, and mine, instead of
forming an exception to the general rule, would bear the application
of the following words of Sir Walter Scott, much better than the
career of their illustrious author. “There is no man known at all in
literature, who may not have more to tell of his private life than I
have. I have surmounted no difficulties either of birth or education,
nor have I been favoured by any particular advantages, and my life
has been as void of incidents of importance as that of the weary
knife-grinder&mdash;‘Story! God bless you, I have none to tell, Sir.’”</p>

<p>Thus my birth was neither so humble that, like John Jones, I have been
obliged amongst my lays to lay the cloth, and to court the cook and
the muses at the same time; nor yet so lofty, that, with a certain
lady of title, I could not write without letting myself down. Then,
for education, though on the one hand I have not taken my degree, with
Blucher; yet on the other, I have not been rusticated, at the Open Air
School, like the poet of Helpstone. As for incidents of importance, I
remember none, except being drawn for a soldier, which was a hoax, and
having the opportunity of giving a casting vote on a great parochial
question, only I didn’t attend. I have never been even third in a duel,
or crossed in love. The stream of time has flowed on with me very like
that of the New River,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span> which everybody knows has so little romance
about it, that its head has never troubled us with a Tale. My own story
then, to possess any interest, must be a fib.</p>

<p>Truly given, with its egotism and its barrenness, it would look too
like the chalked advertisements on a dead wall. Moreover, Pope has read
a lesson to self-importance in the Memoirs of P.P., the Parish Clerk,
who was only notable after all amongst his neighbours as a swallower of
loaches. Even in such practical whims and oddities I am deficient,&mdash;for
instance, eschewing razors, or bolting clasp-knives, riding on painted
ponies, sleeping for weeks, fasting for months, devouring raw tripe,
and similar eccentricities, which have entitled sundry knaves, quacks,
boobies, and brutes, to a brief biography in the Wonderful Magazine.
And, in the absence of these distinctions, I am equally deficient in
any spiritual pretensions. I have had none of those experiences which
render the lives of saintlings, not yet in their teens, worth their own
weight in paper and print, and consequently my personal history, as a
Tract, would read as flat as the Pilgrim’s Progress without the Giants,
the Lions, and the grand single combat with the Devil.</p>

<p>To conclude my life,&mdash;“upon my life,”&mdash;is not worth giving or taking.
The principal just suffices for me to live upon; and of course, would
afford little interest to anyone else. Besides, I have a bad memory;
and a personal history would assuredly be but a middling one, of which
I have forgotten the beginning and cannot foresee the end. I must,
therefore, respectfully decline giving my life to the world&mdash;at least
till I have done with it&mdash;but to soften the refusal, I am willing,
instead of a written character of myself, to set down all that I can
recall of other authors, and, accordingly, the next number will contain
the first instalment of</p>

ECLOGUE.</h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A Back Parlour at Camberwell. Sylvanus is seated at the
breakfast-table, and greeteth his friend Civis.</p></div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;A good morrow to you, friend Civis, and a hearty
welcome!&mdash;How hath sleep dealt with you through the night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;Purely indeed, and with rare pastoral dreams. I have
done nothing but walk through pleasant groves, or sit me down under
shady boughs, the whole livelong night. A foretaste, my friend, of the
rural delights yet to come, in strolling with you amongst the dainty
shades of this your verdant retreat. How have I yearned all through the
month of June, to be a Jack-i’-the-Green again amidst your leaves here!
You know my prospect in town.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Aye, truly; I did once spend, or rather misspend a whole
week there in the dog-days. You looked out opposite on a scorching
brick front of six stories, with a south aspect&mdash;studded with I know
not how many badges of Assurance from fire, and not without need&mdash;for
the shop windows below seemed all a-blaze with geranium-coloured silks,
at that time the mode, and flamme d’enfer. The left-hand shop, next
door, was all red, likewise, with regiments of lobsters, in their new
uniforms; beyond that, a terrible flaring Red Lion, newly done up with
paint. At the next door, a vender of red morocco pocket-books&mdash;my eyes
were in a scarlet fever, the whole time of my sojourning.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;A true picture, I confess. We are, indeed, a little
strong in the warm tints; but they give the more zest to your suburban
verdure. All the way down overnight, I thought only of the two tall elm
trees beside your gate, and which have always been to my city optics as
refreshing as a pair of green spectacles. Surely of all spots I have
seen, Camberwell is the greenest, as the poet says, that ever laid hold
of Memory’s waist.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;It hath been greener aforetime. But I pray you sit down
and fall to.&mdash;Shall I help you to some of this relishing salted fish?</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;By your good leave, Sylvanus, I will first draw up these
blinds. My bed-room, you know, looks out only to the road, and I am
longing to help my eyes, to a little of what, as a citizen, I may truly
call the green fat of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Nay, Civis&mdash;I pray you let the blinds alone. The rolls
are getting cold. This ham is excellently well cured, and the eggs are
new-laid. Come, take a seat.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;I beseech your patience for one moment. There the
blind is up. What a brave flood of sunshine&mdash;and what a glorious blue
sky!&mdash;What a rare dainty day to roam abroad in, dallying with the
Dryads!&mdash;But what do I behold! Oh, my Sylvanus, the Dryads are stripped
of their green kirtles&mdash;stark naked! The trees are all bare, God help
me! as bare as the “otamies in Surgeons’ Hall!”</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;You would take no forewarning&mdash;I bade you not pull up
the blind. It was my intent to have broken the truth to you, after you
had made a full meal; but now you must to breakfast with what appetite
you may!</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;As I hope to see Paradise&mdash;there is not a green bough
between this and Peckham!</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;No, truly, not a twig! I would not advise any forlorn
Babes to die in our woods, for Cock Robin would be painfully perplext
to provide them with a pall. Alas! were a Butterfly to be born in our
bowers, there is not a leaf to swaddle it in.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;Miserable man that I am, to have come down so late, or
rather that winter should have arrived thus early! Ungenial climate!
untimely Boreas!</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Blame not Boreas, nor winter neither. Boiling heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> had
more part than freezing point in this havoc. To think that even summer
nowadays should go by steam!</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;You speak in Sphynxian riddles! Oh, my Sylvanus, tell
me in plain English prose what has become of the green emeralds of the
forest?</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Destroyed in one day by a swarm of locusts. Not the
locusts of Scripture, such as were eaten by St. John in the wilderness,
but a new species. I caught one in the fact, on the very elm tree you
wot of, and which it had stripped to the bone, saving one bough.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">A NEW LOCUST.</p>
</div>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;I am glad, with all my heart, that you have him secure,
for I delight to gaze on the wonders of nature, even of the destructive
kinds. You shall show me your new locust. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> course you thrusted a pin
through the body, and fixed it down to a cork after the manner of the
entomologists.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;No, truly; for it knocked me down after the manner of
the pugilists, and so made its escape.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;How! be they so huge, then? To my fancy, they seem more
like flying dragons than locusts.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;It is true, notwithstanding. Some of them which I have
seen, measured nearly six feet in length; others, that were younger,
from three to five. One of these last, the Minimi, or small fry, I
likewise took captive, though not without some shrewd kicking and
biting, and striking with its fore-paws.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;The smallest of animals will do so to escape from
bondage. I take for granted you knocked him on the head, for the sake
of peace.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;No, indeed. I had not the heart; the visage was so
strangely human, ape or monkey could not look more like a man in the
face; and then it cried and whined for all the world like a mere boy.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;It would have been a kind of petty murder to slay him.
I do not think I could commit Monkeycide myself. They look, as Lady
Macbeth says, so like our Fathers. To kill an ape would plant the
whole stings of an apiary in my conscience. I pray you go on with the
description.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Willingly, and according to the system of the great
Linnæus. Antennæ or horns he had none, thus differing from the common
locust, but in lieu thereof, sundry bunches and tufts of coarse red
hair; eyes brown, and tending inwards towards the proboscis or snout.
Two fore-legs or arms terminating in ten palpi or feelers, and the same
number of toes or claws on the hinder feet. On grasping truncus, or the
trunk, it was cased in a loose skin resembling corduroy, the same being
most curiously furnished with sundry bags or pouches, into which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> like
the provident pelican, it stuffed the forage it had collected from the
trees.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;With submission, Sylvanus, to your better judgment, I
should have taken this same Locust, from your description, to have been
actually a mere human boy.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Between ourselves, he was&mdash;though of what nation or
parentage I know not. To use his own heathenish jargon, he was doing “a
morning fake on the picking lay for a cove wot add a tea-crib in the
monkery.”</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;A strange gibberish, but I do remember that Peter the
Wild Boy was wont to discourse in the same uncouth fashion. Poor savage
of the woods! I do feel for his pitiful estate; but what could move him
to pluck off all-the green emeralds of the Forest?</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;To make sham Hyson and mock Souchong. Even in June you
would have deemed it was November, there were so many ragged Guys
collecting gunpowder. Oh, Civis, thou hast no notion of the tea-trade
that hath been carried on in these parts. Many times I have believed
myself to be dwelling in Canton, and that my name was Hum. Thrice I
have caught myself marvelling at the huge feet of Mrs. S., and have
groped behind my nape for the national pigtail.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;Sylvanus, spare me. I have but one green week in the
year, and here it is all blotted out of the calendar. I pray you do not
jest with me. What hath become of the leaves of yon sycamore?</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Plucked by a Blackamoor, who preferred it to the
climbing of chimneys.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;And yonder Ashes, which I could mourn for in appropriate
sackcloth?</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Stripped by the select young gentleman of Seneca-house,
who left the politer branches of education for the purpose. Scholars,
you know, will play truant gratis, and these had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> opportunity of
performing it at twopence the hour. One Saturday they did turn their
half-holiday into a whole one, and were found by the geographical
master picking Chinese Pekoe and Padre on the sloe bushes and willows
of Peckham Rye.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;Oh, my Sylvanus, such then is the cause of the
desolation I survey. To think that I may have myself helped to swallow
the verdure that I should now be sitting under. That the green
Druidical leaves, instead of clothing the Dryads, should be assisting
in the sweeping of my own Kidderminster carpets!</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;Verily so it is. The great god Pan is dead, and Pot will
reign in his stead.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;Such a misfortune was never before read in a tea-cup!
Oh, my Sylvanus, what is to become of patriotism or love of the
country, when the best part of the country is turned to grouts?</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;I have heard by way of rumour, that Mistress Shakerly
of our village, attributes her palsy to a dash of aspen in her British
Congo; indeed there be shrewd doubts abroad whether the great Projector
hath been at all reforming by turning over a new leaf. Mr. Fairday, the
notable chemist, hath sworn solemnly on his affidavit, that the tea is
strongly emetical, having always acted upon his stomach as tea and turn
out.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;They have tested it, and tasted it to boot. Dr. Budd,
the Pennyroyal Professor of Botany, hath ranked it with the rankest
of poisons, after experimenting its destructive virtues on select tea
parties of his relations and friends.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;And I doubt not Dr. Rudd, of the same Royal College,
hath added a confirmation to this christening.</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;You know the proverb. Doctors’ opinions do not keep
step, or match together, better than their horses. Dr. Rudd hath given
this beverage with cream of tartar and sugar of lead to consumptives,
and hath satisfied himself morally and physically that phthisic does
not begin with tea.</p>

</div>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;Dr. Rudd is an ass! Oh, my Sylvanus, I am sick at heart!
Only two days since I did purchase a delectable book of poems, called
“Foliage,” purposely to read under your trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> but how can I enjoy
it, when the very foliage of nature is, as the booksellers say, out of
print! “Bare ruined quires where late the sweet birds sung.”</p>

<p>S<span class="smaller">YL</span>.&mdash;My friend, take comfort. This tea-tray will not be
brought up another year, for the counterfeit herb hath all been seized,
and condemned to be burnt in the yard of the Excise.</p>

<p>C<span class="smaller">IV</span>.&mdash;I am glad on’t, for it will be, as the French say, “a
feu-de-joie;” and verily all the little singing birds ought to collect
on the chimney-pots to chaunt a Tea Deum. In the mean time I must
borrow Job’s patience under my boils, though they be of the size of
kettles, and have boiled away my summer at a gallop. Possibly you may
have fewer locusts another season; but by way of precaution, the next
time I come down by the stage I shall attend to an old stage direction
in Macbeth, namely, “Enter the army with their green boughs in their
hands.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I <span class="smaller">AM</span> going, my masters, to tell you a strange romantic, aye,
necromantic, sort of story&mdash;and yet every monosyllable of it is as true
as the Legend of Dumpsius. If you should think otherwise, I cannot help
it. All I can say is, you are not experte credo, or expert at believing.</p>

<p>You must know, then, that on a certain day, of a certain year, certain
officers went on certain information, to a certain house, in a certain
court, in a certain city, to take up a certain Italian for a certain
crime. What gross fools are they who say there is nothing certain in
this world! However, in they went, with a crash and a dash, and a
grip and a grapple, and if they did not take him by the scruff of the
neck, like a dog, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> no truth in St. Winifred’s Well. He made
no resistance, not so much as a left-hander, though he was by trade a
smasher. As for any verbal defence, he never so much as attempted to
lay a lie, much less to hatch one. There he was, caught in the very
thing, act and fact, as poor a devil as need be to be making money.
He was as dead as any die he had about him: as sure of a gallows and
a rope, as if he had paid for them down on the nail of before-hand.
Oh, ye City Crœsuses, what think ye of a man having his quantum
suffocate of twisted hemp for making money! For my own part, if I was
to swing for saying so, I’d cry out like a Stentor, that one of God’s
images ought not to be made worm’s meat of for only washing the King’s
face. ’Twould be a very hard-boiled case, and yet, ’fore Gog and Magog,
so it was. For gilding a brass farthing he was to change twelve stone
of good human flesh to a clod of clay; to change a jolly, laughing,
smiling, grinning, crying, wondering, staring, face-making face for a
mere caput mortuum; to change prime tripe, delicate cow-heel, succulent
trotters, for a mouthful of dust; to change a garret for a grave; to
change a neckcloth for a halter. Zounds! what a deal of change for a
bad half sovereign! Well, there he was, caught like a rat, and going
for a tit-bit to the furr’d Law-Cats, and without so much as giving a
squeak for his life. The counterfeits were on him, so he had nothing to
utter. I verily believe, if you had found him in twice as many melting
pots, and crucibles, and dies, and white or brown gravy to boot, he
could not have coined an excuse. As I said before, he was found <i>with
the mould upon him</i>, and that, as the sexton of St. Sepulchre will
tell you, is as good as a burial to you any day of your life. He was
legally dead, and could not look, like other men, upon the sun as his
sun-in-law, so he wisely shook hands with himself, and bade good-bye to
himself, and did not attempt with his tongue to lick the cub of guilt
into a child of grace. All he asked, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> to be allowed to take with
him a little reptile, or insect of some sort that he had brought over
from Italy, belike to be a solace to his captivity; for Baron Trenck,
you know, made a bon-camarade of a prison rat, and Monsieur F., in
the Bastile, as you know equally, made a long-standing friend of a
daddy-longlegs. We live in a world of whims. We eat them, and drink
them, and court them, and marry them, take them to bed and board with
us, and why not to prison? So Tonio begged for his whim to keep him
company, and as it was a small gentle-looking whim, neither so fierce
as a lion, nor so huge as an elephant, and moreover as it was a whim no
ways dangerous to Church or State, he was allowed to take it with him
in a little box, which he carried in his bosom.</p>

<p>Now, if curiosity should itch to know what his whim was like, let it
be known, once for all, that it was like neither a toad, nor a spider,
nor a viper, nor a snail, nor a black beetle, nor a newt, but something
between the size of a crocodile and a cricket. And as for the manner of
its going, it either flew, or swam, or hopped, or crawled, or lay still
like an oyster, for the Newgate Calendar does not say which. Why it
was not a monkey, or a tortoise, or a marmot, Tonio being an Italian,
you must ask of the Foreign Secretary at the Court of the King of the
Beggars.</p>

<p>May I transmigrate&mdash;when Brahma passes my soul into the parish of St.
Brute&mdash;may I transmigrate, I say, into a butcher’s daughter’s pet-lamb,
if it was not a piteous sight to see Tonio going off between the two
law terriers to have an hour’s wearing of that last cravat, which never
goes to a laundress, but always hangs upon a line of its own. It must
be owned, that he had his whim, but for all the whims that ever were
whimmed I wouldn’t have had his crick i’ the neck. Let me, I say, stand
on terra firma; I’m content with the look-out I have of life without
coveting a bird’s-eye view. Old Haman, when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> forty cubits high,
had not a better prospect of this world than I have from the ground
floor. Poor Tonio! It was a sorry sight; and if I didn’t pity him, from
my soul, may I be an hour behind time for seeing the next hanging bout,
and all through getting, by mistake, into a blunderbus. A blunderbus,
my masters, is the wrong omnibus.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">A LEGAL CONVEYANCE.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, law took its course as usual, that is to say, like a greyhound
after a hare. Tony was put up, so-ho’d, run after, run over, run
before, turned, tumbled and mumbled, scud and scut, and gripped by
the jugulars. But that’s a scurvy simile to another I have, lapped up
in pancakes, so give the calendar a shove backwards, and suppose it
Shrovetide, and poor Tony stuck up in dock by way of a shy-cock for the
law limbs to shy at. You never saw such pelting in your life; no, not
even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span> St. Swithin took it into her watery head to rain cats and
dogs! First, the Foreman of the Grand Jury jerked a true bill at him,
that took effect on his head. Thereupon the Clerk of Arraigns pitched a
heavy indictment in his very teeth, so that it shivered into thirteen
separate counts. Then the Council for the Crown heaved a brief of forty
folios into the pit of his stomach; anon opening a masked battery, he
threw in sworn witnesses in a volley like bombshells, and when they
exploded there flew out from them two melting pots, four moulds, nine
bulls, and seven-and-twenty hogs, and every hog of them weighed in
evidence upwards of ninety stone. Finally, the Chief Pitcher himself
pitched at him his great wig, and his fur gown, and his gold chain,
and his mace, and his great inkstand, and the King’s crown, and the
lion and the unicorn, everything in short he could catch up, and then,
taking both hands, he heaved at him the Statutes at Large; not content
with which he took next to pelt him with pairs of missiles at once. For
instance, a horse and a hurdle, a gallows and a halter, a shovel-hat
and a condemned sermon, a last dying speech and an elm coffin, and,
last of all, may I die of the pip the next time I eat oranges, if he
didn’t cast at him the whole steeple of St. Sepulchre, death-bell and
all, as if it had been only a snow-ball.</p>

  <p class="caption mbot1">THROWING THE LASSO.</p>
</div>

<p>Never was St. Stephen so pelted. No wonder in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> that under
such a huge heap of rubbish, he became utterly dumbfounded, bamboozled,
obfuscated, mizmazed, spifflicated, flummockst, and flabbergasted;
seeing which the Chief Pitcher, as usual, enquired whether he had
the infinitesimal of a word to say against being strangled into a
blackamoor, with the very eyes of his head giving notice to quit.
What matter that Tony had a bramble in his mind, that bore reasons
like blackberries, and ripe ones too; as for example, that a tight
rope round the gullet is very bad for the health, and particularly
when one’s health requires to take pills, or even boluses, three
times a day? I say, he might have given a thousand such reasonable
reasons against hanging, but the very momentous minute of opening his
mouth, the Chief Pitcher pitched into it a prodigious great bung,
as dab and apt and cleverly as if he had played at nothing else but
chuck-farthing and pitch-in-the-hole ever since he was fourteen. So
the mummy of silence being preserved, the Merlinising began, and hey
presto! before you could say Herman Boaz, the big wig was turned into
a black cap! After that you may tell the world that our Judges are no
conjurors. Thus the trial ended, and Tony’s sentence, as taken in the
hieroglyphical short-hand, ran thus: namely, “that he was to be sent on
a Black Monday to the Deaf and Dumb School that is kept in a coffin.”</p>

<p>All this time, mark you, he had the whim with him in the dock, and
to look at it now and then seemed his only comfort in life,&mdash;how it
whisked and frisked, and looked about it, and fed heartily, as if there
had been no such thing as law or law-cats in the blessed world; and
when Tony went back, like a volume of felony, to be bound in stone,
the whim still went with him to his cell, and from his cell to the
press-room, and from the press-room to the debtor’s door, and from the
debtor’s door to death’s door itself, which opens on the scaffold, as
you turn off to the right hand or the left, in your way to nobody knows
where. To take such a whim of a reptile with one to the gallows, seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
whimsical enough; but the Emperor Adrian, if you read the classics,
had such a vagabondish, blandish, little animal, his animula vagula
blandula, to be with him on his death-bed.</p>

<p>Well, Friday came, and Saturday, and Sunday, and Sunday’s night; he was
posting to eternity with four bolters. I will bet the whole national
debt he would have given eighteen-pence a mile, and half-a-crown to the
boy, to have been posting on any other road. All the favour the law
allowed him was to have an Ordinary at eight instead of an ordinary at
one, a very ordinary favour to a man who was about to leave off dining.
But the devil ought to have his due, and so should the Lord Mayor and
the Sheriffs. As they had neglected Tony a little, by not being with
the other gossips at his christening, to usher him into this world,
they attended very ceremoniously to show him out of it, each in his
gilt coach; and, with regard to the coachmen, the footmen, and even
the very horses themselves, they were all Malthusians. Of course the
Recorder brought the hanging-warrant, and if you would know what the
hanging-warrant was like, it was like a map of <i>Cheshire</i> with the
<i>Mersey</i> left out.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you, that before it came to this pass, the Ordinary
came oftentimes to the cell where Tony was, to pray, besides whom there
was an Extraordinary, who examined him on his points of faith. And the
points of faith were these; namely, whether he believed the moon to be
of green cheese, and as to the size of the mites thereon. Secondly, if
he believed the puppet-play of Punch and Judy to be a type of the fall
of Nineveh; and, thirdly, concerning the lions in Pilgrim’s Progress,
whether they were bred at Mr. Wombwell’s or Mr. Cross’s, or at the
Tower of London. To all of which Tony giving decidedly serious answers,
he was pronounced fit to die, and quite prepared to have his neck
stretched, as long as the throttle of a claret-bottle when the wine is
ropy.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the morning of Monday, Time laid his long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> hand upon
Tony’s collar, and gave him eight distinct hints that his hour was
come for being ornithologised by sentence of the great Law Bird, genus
Black-cap, into jail bird, genus Wryneck. Never was there such mobbing
to see a hanging. Half the Londoners that morning went without their
breakfasts to be in time for the Old Bailey. Trot, trot, trot, canter
and full gallop; away through Piccadilly; push on there, in the Strand,
hey down Holborn Hill, with a yoicks in Cheapside, and a hark forward
in Newgate Street, and a tally ho! in West Smithfield. They all meant
to be in at the death. Never was there such a race, to see a man whose
race was run losing it by a neck. And the order of the running was
thus:&mdash;The Royal Humane Society got in first at the Drop, and had an
excellent front row. The Society for Preventing Cruelty to Animals
was a good second; and may I die, if the Law Life Assurance hadn’t
the assurance to come third. Next came the Philanthropic Society,
with the Society of Good Samaritans barely a length behind; and then
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, neck and neck with the
London Benevolent Society; all racing till they panted again, to see
Tony put out of breath. You never saw such a chevy! Luckily there was
no Anniversary at St. Paul’s, so the Sons of the Clergy cantered in
with all the children of all the parishes that had any charity, to see
an execution put in for the debt of Nature. Also the Medical Society
came to see one die by the New Dropsy; and all the Knights of the
Garter, with their orders, <i>it being a collar-day</i>, wherefore they wore
their garters according to the fashion of Miss Bailey; and all the
Foreign Ambassadors. Seeing which, Tony put on a good face, and walked
stoutly up the ladder, saying softly to himself, “the eyes of Europe
are upon you.” All being ready, with the Ordinary on the right hand,
and the Extraordinary on the left, and the Great Constrictor a little
behind, Tony (who had his whim with him) was asked how he felt himself,
and how his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> father and mother did, and all his little brothers and
sisters; to which he answered thankfully, that they were all very well,
and that for his own part, he felt very comfortable, and died in the
faith of St. Vitus. Now the faith of St. Vitus is not exactly the faith
of the Church of England, nor, in faith, do I well know what faith
it is; but the Ordinary took no objection to it, for he was a man in
favour of universal toleration, remembering the saying of the heathen
Priest of Apollo to the Bishop of Magnum Bonum, “You have <i>your</i>
thology, and let me have <i>my</i>thology.” So the Ordinary held his peace,
but the Extraordinary would fain have argued the point regularly and
methodically, according to the dogmatical manner of Cerberus, namely,
in a discourse with three heads; and if he had once begun to spin the
triple yarn of controversy, prosyversy, and viceversy into a cable,
there is no saying on oath whether the other rope might have been used
to this day. Seeing, therefore, how matters stood, Master Strangulator
pushed in, with an elbowing manner, and began begging pardon of Tony
for the part he was about to perform, who forgave him very readily,
requesting him moreover to shake hands, and by Gog and Magog, such a
shake was never shaked since the Shakers became a sect!</p>

<p>At the first grapple of their fingers, the Strangulator pulled away his
hand with a jerk, as if a bear’s palm had been palmed upon him instead
of a human paw. Then, after making a frightful face, he gave a mighty
great spring or vault upwards, a deal higher than the gallows, when,
on coming down, he alighted with his legs a-straddle upon the beam,
where he kept posturing for some five minutes; now rowing with his
arms and legs, like a fish, now hanging with his head downwards, first
by one leg and then by the other, then by one hand, and then again
by his chin; you never saw a rope-dancer or tumbler of them all, at
Bartlemy’s or Astley’s, more nimble. Then coming down to the stage with
a bound, he threw three summersets forward, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> three backwards,
as quick as thought. Anon, after standing for a minute in the first
position, he fell a-dancing with all his might and main, and as fast
as he could lift his feet, like a bear upon a hotted floor. Never was
such a spring danced round about the gallows-tree; Gilderoy was a fool
to him. You may guess how the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and the Ordinary
and Extraordinary, stared at such a caper, till their eyes grew as big
as owls’; and still more when they saw Tony, after making a round O
of his mouth, fall to bouncing and bounding like another Oscar Byrne!
Shade of Holbein, what a Dance of Death! Only think of Jack Ketch and
the condemned dancing face to face on the drop, now poussetting, now
setting to each other, now allemanding, now waltzing, and then, Father
of Vestris, what a tableau! Tony figuring, opera-fashion, on one leg,
with Cheshire poising on tip-toe on the calf of the other! As for his
whim, it was jerked out of the box at the first frisk, and had enough
to do, you may be sure, to scuttle out of the way of the skipping and
hopping; as it was, the poor reptile got more kicks than ha’pence.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Humanes, and the Samaritans, and the
Benevolents, and the rest of the mob, did not stand and look on
quite as mum as if it had been an overbrimming Quaker’s meeting,
with a collection afterwards at the door for the Deaf and Dumb.
They chuckled, and crowed, and laughed till they brayed again;
and roared, and bellowed, and shouted, and shrieked like hyænas
in hysterics. “Huzza! huzzaw! Go it, Jack! That’s your sort
encore&mdash;ancore&mdash;anker&mdash;ancoore,&mdash;bravo&mdash;brawvo&mdash;bravoo&mdash;brawvoo!
Well done Tony&mdash;Tony for ever&mdash;Tony for my money!&mdash;keep it up! It’s
better than dancing upon nothing.” If Laporte had been there, who
knows what offer he might have made them; for Taglioni herself never
danced so&mdash;that is to say, gratis, and without music. On they jigged,
however, without let or stint, and may I hang my hat up for ever, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the same whim did not suddenly take the marshal, janitor, or head
gaoler, however unfit for dancing, seeing that one of his legs was
made of the same flesh as my oak table. Timber or not, he balanced on
it for a whole minute, while the other foot’s great toe, far above his
hip, pointed exactly at the clock of St. Sepulchre, and then swinging
his arms like a horizontal windmill, he spun off into a whirlwind of
pirouettes that made one giddy to look at. That done, he struck in
between the other two with a real step, and they immediately began to
work out a dancing sum in the rule of three, which requires only one
figure, namely, a figure of eight. Scuffle, shuffle, in and out, the
three Kirk Alloway witches could not have footed it better. In fact,
there was no resisting it. The whim took the very Ordinary himself,
though less boisterously at first, by reason of the gravity of his
calling, wherefore, taking a graceful grip with either hand of his
cassock, he only glided off, to begin with, into the minuet de la
cour. However, as the dancing grew more fast and furious, he gradually
danced, in spite of himself, having been classically bred, into the
College Hornpipe, and I defy anyone to say they ever saw it better
danced, or more briskly, by the very Doctors of Oxford and Cambridge.
Mother of Almack’s, what a quadrille! What a ball! The three Fates,
though winders of thread, and spinsters in ordinary, had never seen
such a Cotton ball! It was the strangest capriccio, the rarest mad
morrice that ever was danced; one minute a mazurka, then a polonaise,
then a gallopade, then a fandango, then a bolero, then a saraband,
then a guaracha, then a Highland fling! Sometimes the Strangulator, by
help of the halter which he waved this way and that, seemed executing
the shawl dance; anon, he doubled shuffled like Dusty Bob. One minute
Tony appeared as measuring his steps with a duchess dowager of the time
of Louis the Fourteenth; the next he was snapping his fingers with
Maggie Lauder to the tune of Tullochgorum. You fancied one minute, that
the Ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> was dancing a pas seul, to the music of Haydn’s slow
movement, and before you could say Jack Robinson (now Earl of Ripon)
he started off into as grotesque a burlesque as ever was flung, and
floundered, and flounced, and bounced, and shuffled, and scuffled,
and draggled, and wiggle-waggled, shambled, gambolled, scrambled, and
skimble-skambled by Grimaldi, in Mother Goose. Blessed were they who
were born to behold it, though but from the mother’s arms. It was
worth going five miles to see, the first mile trundling a coach-wheel,
the second picking up eggs, the third hopping on one leg, the fourth
backwards, and the fifth jumped in a sack. If any man think otherwise,
may he dance, that is to say, in a ten-acre meadow, with a mohawking
bully of a bull for a partner.</p>

</div>

<p>The whim next seized the Extraordinary, and he danced like a dancing
Fakir. He jumped, and thumped, and twirled, and whirled, and so did
the rest, till the great drops rolled down their foreheads, for it
was in the very middle of the dog-days, and verily if Sirius did not
become a dancing dog it was not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> want of masters. The clock struck
nine, and still they were at it, cross hands, down the middle, and back
again&mdash;’twas a mercy the bolt held. Chassez-croisez, dos-a-dos!&mdash;it was
getting on for ten, and yet they never called a fresh set! high time,
my masters, for authority to interfere; but the Head of the Corporation
had no sooner set the foot of the corporation on the scaffold, than the
whole of the corporation gave way to the whim, and was carried off with
a swagger into the medley, as if it had been the great ball at Easter.
There, I say, was the Mayor of London, scarlet cloak, and fur, and gold
chain and all, capering like a climbing boy, on the first of May. If
you had seen that morris danced, ’tis long odds, Londoners, you would
not have known your own May’r from a Hobbyhorse.</p>

<p>The Sheriffs came next, and they gave in to the same whim and danced,
and so did three Phrenologists who were in waiting to take a cast of
the skull, and another old woman who had got upon the scaffold to
be stroked on the neck for a wen. Though her dancing day was over,
she hobbled her best, and so did a Jew who came up to haggle for the
criminal’s clothes, and likewise an amateur in hangings, who meant to
bid high for a piece of the rope. These all danced, and God knows how
many more might have joined the corps de ballet, but for a certain
leap that was leaped by the Lord Mayor, and which knocked the whim on
the head. Now the Lord Mayor’s weight in the City, in mere flesh, was
a matter of sixteen stone (on the 10th of November a little more) and
his gold chain was seventy-five pounds, as good Troy weight as if Priam
had weighed it himself. He had besides in his pocket, two hundred and
fifty thousand pounds in gold, ninety-five thousand pounds in silver,
and five thousand seven hundred pounds in copper; moreover in his fob
was an old family watch, formerly the clock of St. Dunstan, equal to
ninety-five pounds and a half. Lastly, he carried on his person a
huge bunch of keys, house keys, warehouse keys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> shop keys, cellar
keys, and particularly wine cellar keys, cupboard keys, and especially
pantry keys, and above all the Master Key of the City, which at any old
iron shop, would have been reckoned at a hundred pounds. Only think,
my masters, when such a corporate body jumped, only think, I say,
with what a confounding, astounding, crashing, smashing, flattening,
pancake-making sole of a foot it would come down on any reptile short
of a crocodile. No wonder, then, that Tony’s whim was completely
atomised, obliterated, and annihilated, which it was so utterly, that
if you were to search on the gallows to-morrow, with a solar microscope
to help you, I don’t believe, on my soul, that you would find the least
article or particle of the cuticle of</p>

<p>T<span class="smaller">HE</span> consulter of Johnson’s Dictionary under the term of Sport, or
Sporting, would be led into a great mistake by the Doctor’s definition.
The word, with the great Lexicographer, signifies nothing but
Diversion, Amusement, Play:&mdash;but I shall submit to the reader, with a
few facts, whether it has not a more serious connexion, or to speak
technically, whether it should be Play or Pay.</p>

</div>

<p>When I was a young man, having a good deal of ready money, and little
wit,&mdash;I went upon the Turf. I began cautiously, and as I thought,
knowingly. I studied the studbook, and learnt the pedigree of every
new colt&mdash;yet somehow, between sire and dam, continually losing “the
pony.” My first experiment was at Newmarket. By way of securing a
leading article, I backed the Duke of <i>Leeds</i>, but the race came off,
and the Duke was not placed. I asked eagerly who was <i>first</i>, and
was told <i>Fourth</i>. The winner was a slow but strong horse, and I was
informed had got in front by being a <i>laster</i>. This was a <i>puzzle</i>, but
I paid for my Riddlesworth, and prepared for the Derby. By good luck
I selected an excellent colt to stand upon&mdash;he had been tried&mdash;it was
a booked thing&mdash;but the day before the Derby there was a family wash,
and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> Laundress hung her wet linen on his <i>lines</i>. I paid again.
I took advice about the Oaks, and instead of backing a single horse,
made my stand, like Ducrow, upon four at once. No luck. Terror did not
start&mdash;Fury came roaring to the post&mdash;Belle was told out, and Comet
was tail’d off. I paid again&mdash;and began dabbling in the Sweepstakes,
and burning my fingers with the Matches. Amongst others, a bet offered
that I conceived was peculiarly tempting, 20,000 to 20 against Post
Obit&mdash;a bad horse indeed, yet such odds seemed unjustifiable, even
against “an outsider.” But I soon found my mistake. The outsider was in
reality an insider,&mdash;filling the stomachs of somebody’s hounds.&mdash;Pay
again! I resolved however to retaliate, and the opportunity presented
itself. I had been confidently informed that Centipede had not a leg to
stand on, and accordingly laid against him as thick as it would stick.
The following was the report of the race: “Centipede jumped off at a
tremendous pace,&mdash;had it all his own way&mdash;and justified his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> by
coming in a hundred feet in front.”&mdash;Pay again! These “hollow” matters
however fretted me little, save in pocket. They were won easy, and lost
to match&mdash;but the “near things” were unbearable. To lose only by half
a head,&mdash;a few inches of horse-flesh! I remember two occasions when
Giraffe won by “a neck,” and Elephant by “a nose.” I was almost tempted
to blow out my brains by the nose, and to hang myself by the neck!</p>

<p>On one of those doubtful occasions, when it is difficult to name the
winner, I thought I could determine the point, from some peculiar
advantage of situation, and offered to back my opinion. I laid that
Cobbler had won, and it was taken; but a signal from a friend decided
me that I was wrong, and by way of hedge, I offered to lay that Tinker
was the first horse. This was taken like the other, and the Judges
declared a dead rob&mdash;I mean to say a dead heat.&mdash;Pay again!</p>

<p>A likelier chance next offered. There was a difference of opinion,
whether Bohea would start for the Cup, and his noble owner had
privately and positively assured me that he would. I therefore betted
freely that he would <i>run</i> for the Plate, and he <i>walked</i> over!&mdash;Pay
again! N.B. I found, when it was too late, that I should not have paid
in this case, but I did.</p>

<p>The Great St. Leger was still in reserve. Somewhat desperate, I betted
round, in sums of the same shape, and my best winner became first
favourite at the start. Never shall I forget the sight! I saw him come
in ten lengths a-head of everything&mdash;hollow! hollow! I had no voice to
shout with, and it was fortunate. Man and horse went, as usual, after
the race, to be weighed, and were put into the scale. They rose a
little in our eyes, and sunk proportionably in our estimation. Roguery
was sniffed&mdash;the Jockey Club was appealed to, and it gave the stakes to
the second horse. All bets went with the stakes, and so&mdash;Pay again!</p>

<p>It was time to cut the turf&mdash;and I was in a mood for burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> it too.
I was done by Heath, but the impression on my fortune was not in the
finished style. I now turned my attention to aquatics, and having been
unfortunate at the One Tun, tried my luck in a vessel of twenty. I
became a member of a Yacht Club, made matches which I lost&mdash;and sailed
for a Cup at the Cowes’ Regatta, but carried away nothing but my own
bowsprit. Other boats showed more speed, but mine most bottom; for
after the match it upset, and I was picked up by a party of fishermen,
who spared my life and took all I had, by way of teaching me, that a
preserving is not a saving.&mdash;Pay again!</p>

<p>It was time to dispose of The Lucky Lass. I left her to the mate,
with peremptory orders to make a sale of her;&mdash;an instruction he
fulfilled by making all the sail on her he could, and disposing of
her&mdash;by contract&mdash;to a rock, while he was threading the Needles. In
the meantime I betook myself to the chase. Sir W. W. had just cut
his pack, and I undertook to deal with the dogs:&mdash;but I found dog’s
meat a dear item, though my friends killed my hunters for me, and I
boil’d my own horses. The subscribers, moreover, were not punctual,
and whatever differences fell out, I was obliged to make them up.&mdash;Pay
again! At last I happened to have a dispute with a brother Nimrod as
to the capability of his Brown and mine, and we agreed to decide their
respective rates, as church rates, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> Steeple Chase. The wager was
heavy. I rode for the wrong steeple&mdash;leapt a dozen gates&mdash;and succeeded
in clearing my own pocket.&mdash;Pay again!</p>

<p>It was now necessary to retrench. I gave up hunting the county, lest
the county should repay it in kind, for I was now getting into its
debt. I laid down my horses and took up a gun, leased a shooting-box,
and rented a manor, somewhat too far north for me, for after a few
moves, I ascertained that the game had been drawn before I took to it.
It was useless therefore to try to beat&mdash;the dogs, for want of birds,
began to point at butterflies. My friends, however, looked for grouse,
so I bought them and paid the carriage.&mdash;Pay again!</p>

<p>Other experiments I must abridge. I found Pugilistic Sporting, as
usual&mdash;good with both hands at receiving:&mdash;at Cocking the “in-goes”
were far exceeded by the “out-goes:”&mdash;and at the gaming table, that
it was very difficult to pay my way&mdash;particularly in coming back.
In short I learned pages of meanings at school without trouble, but
the signification of that one word Sporting, in manhood has been a
long, and an uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> lesson, and I have still an unconquerable
relish of its bitterness, in spite of the considerate attentions of my
Friends&mdash;&mdash;</p>

me, ‘young man, are you Jacob Giles,’&mdash;an’t I to tell him?”</p>

<p>“By no manner of means,” answered Quickset; “say you are quite another
man. No one but a flat would tell his name to a stranger about London.
You see how I answered them last night about what was in the waggon.
Brooms, says I, nothing else. A flat would have told them there was the
honey-pots underneath; but I’ve been to London before, and know a thing
or two.”</p>

<p>“London must be a desperate place,” said Thickset.</p>

<p>“Mortal!” said Quickset, “fobs and pockets are nothing! Your watch is
hardly safe if you carried it in your inside, and as for money&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’m almost sorry I left Berkshire,” said Thickset.</p>

<p>“Poo&mdash;poo,” said Quickset, “don’t be afeard. I’ll look after ye; cheat
me, and they’ve only one more to cheat. Only mind my advice. Don’t say
anything of your own head, and don’t object to anything <i>I</i> say. If I
say black’s white, don’t contradict. Mark that. Say everything as I
say.”</p>

<p>“I understand what you mean,” said Thickset; and with this lesson in
his shock head, he began to busy himself about the waggon, while his
comrade went to the stable for the horses. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span> last Old Ball emerged
from the stable-door with the head of Old Dumpling resting on his
crupper; when a yell rose from the rear of the waggon, that startled
even Number 55, at the Bush Inn, at Staines, and brought the company
running from the remotest box in its retired tea-garden.</p>

</div>

<p>“In the name of everything,” said the landlord, “what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“It’s gone&mdash;all gone, by goles!” cried Thickset, with a bewildered look
at Quickset, as if doubtful whether he ought not to have said it was
<i>not</i> gone.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say the honey-pots!” said Quickset, with some
alarm, and letting go the bridle of Old Ball, who very quietly led
old Dumpling back again into the stable; “you don’t mean to say the
honey-pots?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>“I <i>don’t</i> mean to say the honey-pots,” said Thickset, literally
following the instructions he had received.</p>

<p>“What made you screech out then?” said Quickset, appealing to Thickset.</p>

<p>“What made me screech out, then?” said Thickset, appealing to Quickset,
and determined to say as he said.</p>

<p>“The fellow’s drunk,” said the landlord; “the ale’s got into his head.”</p>

<p>“Ale,&mdash;what ale has he had?” enquired Quickset rather anxiously.</p>

<p>“Ale,&mdash;what ale have I had?” echoed Thickset, looking sober with all
his might.</p>

<p>“He’s not drunk,” shouted Quickset; “there’s something the matter.”</p>

<p>“I’m not drunk; there <i>is</i> something the matter,” bellowed Thickset,
and with his fore-finger he pointed to the waggon.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say the honey,” said Quickset, his voice falling.</p>

<p>“I <i>don’t</i> mean to say the honey,” said Thickset, his caution rising.</p>

<p>The gesture of Thickset, however, had conveyed some vague notion of
danger to his companion. With the agility of a cat he climbed on the
waggon, and with the superhuman activity of a demon, soon pitched down
every bundle of besoms. There is a proverb that new brooms sweep clean,
and they certainly seemed to have swept every particle of honey clean
out of the waggon.</p>

<p>Quickset was thunderstruck; he stood gazing at the empty vehicle in
silence; while his hands wandered wildly through his hair, as if in
search of the absent combs.</p>

<p>When he found words at last, they were no part of the Litany. Words,
however, did not suffice to vent his passion; and he began to stamp and
dance about, till the mud of the stable-yard flew round like anything
you like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>“A plague take him and his honey-pots, too,” said the chambermaid, as
she looked at a new pattern on her best gingham.</p>

<p>“It’s no matter,” said Quickset. “I won’t lose it. The house must stand
the damage. Mr. Bush, I shall look to you for the money.”</p>

<p>“He shall look to you for the money,” da-capo’d Thickset.</p>

<p>“You may look till doomsday,” said the landlord. “It’s all your own
fault; I thought nobody would steal brooms. If you had told me there
was honey, I would have put the waggon under lock and key.”</p>

<p>“Why, there <i>was</i> honey,” said Quickset and Thickset.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that,” said Mr. Bush, “you said last night in the kitchen
there was nothing but brooms.”</p>

<p>“I heard him,” said John Ostler; “I’ll take my oath to his very words!”</p>

<p>“And so will I,” roar’d the chambermaid, glancing at her damaged gown.</p>

<p>“What of that?” said Quickset, “I know I said there was nothing but
brooms.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Thickset, “I’m positive, he said there was nothing but
brooms.”</p>

<p>“He confesses it himself,” said the landlady.</p>

<p>“And his own man speaks agin him,” said the chambermaid.</p>

<p>“I saw the waggon come in, and it didn’t seem to have any honey in it,”
said the head waiter.</p>

<p>“May be the flies have eaten it,” said the postillion.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen two chaps the very moral of them two at the bar of the Old
Bailey,” said Boots.</p>

<p>“It’s a swindle, it is,” said the landlady, “and Mr. Bush shan’t pay a
farthing.”</p>

<p>“They deserve tossing in a blanket,” said the chambermaid.</p>

<p>“Duck ’em in the horsepond,” shouted John Ostler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think,” whispered Thickset, “they are making themselves up for
mischief!”</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost. Quickset again lugged Old Ball and Old
Dumpling from the stable, while his companion tossed the brooms into
the waggon. As soon as possible they drove out of the unlucky yard, and
as they passed under the arch, I heard for the last time the voice of
Thickset:</p>

<p>“You’ve been to London before, and to be sure know best; but somehow,
to my mind, the telling the untruth don’t seem to answer.”</p>

<p>The only reply was a thwack, like the report of a pistol, on the
crupper of each of the horses. The poor animals broke directly into
something like a canter: and as the waggon turned a corner of the
street, I shut down the sash, and resumed my “Illustrations of Lying.”</p>

London.</i></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I <span class="smaller">WAS</span> walking very leisurely one evening down Cripplegate, when I
overtook&mdash;who could help overtaking him?&mdash;a lame elderly gentleman,
who, by the nature of his gait, appeared to represent the Ward. Like
certain lots at auctions, he seemed always going, but never gone: it
was that kind of march that, from its slowness, is emphatically called
halting. Gout, in fact, had got him into a sad hobble, and, like
terror, made his flesh creep.</p>

<p>There was, notwithstanding, a lurking humorousness in his face, in
spite of pace, that reminded you of Quick or Liston in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> <i>Old Rapid</i>.
You saw that he was not slow, at least, at a quirk or quip,&mdash;not
backward at repartee,&mdash;not behind-hand with his jest, in short, that he
was a great wit though he could not jump.</p>

<p>There was something, besides, in his physiognomy, as well as his dress
and figure, that strongly indicated his locality. He was palpably a
dweller, if not a native, of that clime distinguished equally by “the
rage of the vulture and the love of the turtle,”&mdash;the good old City of
London. But an accident soon confirmed my surmises.</p>

<p>In plucking out his handkerchief from one of his capacious coat
pockets, the Bandana tumbled out with it a large roll of manuscript;
and as he proceeded a good hundred yards before he discovered the
loss, I had ample time before he struggled back, in his Crawly Common
pace, to the spot, to give the paper a hasty perusal, and even to make
a few random extracts. The MS. purported to be a Collection of Civic
Facetiæ, from the Mayoralty of Alderman * * * * up to the present time:
and, from certain hints scattered up and down, the Recorder evidently
considered himself to have been, for wise saws or witty, the Top
Sawyer. Not to forestal the pleasure of self-publication, I shall avoid
all that are, or may be, his own sayings, and give only such <i>jeux de
mots</i> as have a distinct parentage.</p>

<p class="s5 center mtop1 mbot1">EXTRACTS FROM THE MS.</p>

<p>“Alderman F. was very hard of hearing, and Alderman B. was very hard
on his infirmity. One day, a dumb man was brought to the Justice-room
charged with passing bad notes. B. declined to enter upon the case. ‘Go
to Alderman F.,’ he said: ‘when a dumb man <i>utters</i>, a deaf one ought
to hear it.’”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“B. was equally hard on Alderman V.’s linen-drapery. One day he came
late into Court. ‘I have just come,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span> ‘from V.’s villa. He had
family prayers last night, and began thus&mdash;Now let us read the Psalm
Nunc <i>Dimities</i>.’”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“Old S., the tobacconist of Holborn Hill, wore his own hair tied behind
in a queue, and had a favourite seat in the shop, with his back to the
window. Alderman B. pointed him out once to me. ‘Look! there he is, as
usual, advertising his <i>pigtail</i>.’”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“Alderman A. was never very remarkable for his skill in orthography. A
note of his writing is still extant, requesting a brother magistrate
to preside for him, and giving, <i>literatim</i>, the following reason
for his own absence:&mdash;‘Jackson the painter is to take me off in my
Rob of Office, and I am gone to give him a <i>cit</i>.’ His pronunciation
was equally original. I remember his asking Alderman C., just before
the 9th of November, whether he should have any men in armour in his
<i>shew</i>.”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“Guildhall and its images were always uppermost with Alderman A. It was
he who so misquoted Shakspeare&mdash;‘A Parish Beadle, when he’s trod upon,
feels as much corporal suffering as Gog and Magog.’”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“A well-known editor of a morning paper enquired of Alderman B.,
one day, what he thought of his journal. ‘I like it all,’ said the
Alderman, ‘but its <i>Broken English</i>.’ The editor stared and asked for
an explanation. ‘Why, the <i>List of Bankrupts</i>, to be sure!’”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“When Alderman B. was elected Mayor, to give greater éclat to his
banquet, he sent for Dobbs, the most celebrated cook of that time,
to take the command of the kitchen. Dobbs was quite an enthusiast in
his art, and some culinary deficiencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span> on the part of the ordinary
Mansion-House professors driving him at least to desperation, he
leapt upon one of the dressers, and began an oration to them, by this
energetic apostrophe,&mdash;‘Gentlemen! do you call yourselves cooks!’”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>“One of the present Household titles in the Mansion-House establishment
was of singular origin. When the celebrated men in armour were first
exhibited, Alderman P., who happened to be with his Lordship previous
to the procession, was extremely curious in examining the suits of
mail, &amp;c., expressing, at the same time, an eager desire to try on one
of the helmets. The Mayor, with his usual consideration, insisted on
first sending it down to the kitchen to be aired, after which process
the ambition of the Alderman met with its gratification. For some
little time he did not perceive any inconvenience from his new beaver,
but by degrees the enclosure became first uncomfortably, and then
intolerably warm; the confined heat being aggravated by his violent
but vain struggles to undo the unaccustomed fastenings. An armourer
was obliged to be sent for before his face could be let out, red and
rampant as a Brentford Lion from its iron cage. It appeared, that in
the hurry of the Pageant, the chief Cook had clapped the casque upon
the fire, and thus found out a recipe for stewing an Alderman’s head
in its own steam, and for which feat he has retained the title of the
Head-Cook, ever since!”</p>

<p>“G. the Common-council-man, was a Warden of his own Company, the
Merchant Tailors’. At one of their frequent Festivals, he took with
him, to the dinner, a relation, an officer of the tenth foot. By some
blunder, the soldier was taken for one of the fraternity, but G.
hastened to correct the mistake:&mdash;‘Gentlemen, this isn’t one of the
Ninth parts of a man&mdash;he’s one of the Tenth!’”</p>

<p>Honnerd Sur,&mdash;awar of your parshalty for Liv Stox and Kettle
Breading, ham indust to faver with a Statement of wat is dun at the
Farm, havin tacken provintial Noats wile I was at Kings-ton with
a Pekin elefunt for chainges of Hair. As respex a curacy beg to
say, tho the Sectary drawd up his Report from his hone datums and
memmorandusses, and never set his eyes on my M.E.S.S., yet we has
tallys to our tails in the Mane.</p>

<p>Honnerd Sir,&mdash;I will sit out with the Qadripids, tho weave add the
wust lux with them. Scarse anny of the Anymills with fore legs
has moor nor one Carf. Has to the Wappity Dears, hits wus then
the Babby afore King Sollyman, but their his for one littel Dear
betwin five femail she hinds. The Sambo Dear as was sent by Mr.
Spring was so unnatral has to heat up her Forn and in consequins
the Sing-Sing is of no use for the lullabis. Has for Corsichan hits
moor Boney nor ever, But the Axis on innqueries as too littel Axes
about a munth hold. The Neil Gow has increst one Carf, but their
his no Foles to the Quaggys. Their his too littel Zebry but one as
not rum to grow; the Report says, “the Mail Owen to the Nessessary
Confinement in regard to Spaice is verry smal.”</p>

<p>Honnerd Sur, the Satiety is verry rich in Assis, boath Commun assis
and uncommon assis, and as the Report recumends will do my Inndever
to git the Maltese Cross for your Honner. The Kangroses as reerd up
a large smal fammily but looks to be ill nust and not well put to
there feat, and at the surjesting of a femail Feller too was put
out to the long harmd Babboon to dry nus, but she was too violent
and dandled the pure things to deth. The infunt Zebew is all so
ded owen to Atemps with a backbord to prevent groing out of the
sholders, boath parrents being defourmd with umphs; but the spin as
is suposed was hert in the exspearment, and it sudenly desist. Mr.
Wallack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> will be glad to here the Wallachian Sheap has add sicks
lams, but one was pisend by eating the ewes in the garden witch is
fattle to kattle. Has to gots we was going on prospus in the Kiddy
line, but the Billy gots becum so vishus and did so menny butts a
weak we was obleeged to do away with the Entire. As regards Rabits
a contiguous dissorder havin got into the Stox, we got rid of the
Hole let alone one Do and Brewd, witch was all in good Helth up to
Good Fridy wen the Mother brekfisted on her bunnis. The increas in
the Groth of Hairs as bean maid an object, and the advice tacken
of Mr. Prince and Mr. Roland, who recumendid Killin one of the
Bares for the porpus of Greece. We hav a grate number of ginny
pigs&mdash;their is moor than twenty of them in one Pound.</p>

<p>About Struthus Burds the Ostreaches is in in perfic helth and full
of Plums. The femail Hen lade too egs wile the Committy was sittin
and we hop they will atch, as we put them under a she Hemew as
was sittin to Mr. Harvy. We propos breading Busturds xept we hav
not got a singel specieman of the specious Galnatious Burds. I am
sory to say The Curryso has not bread. Hits the moor disapinting
as we considder these Birds as our Crax. We sucksided in razing a
grate menny Turkys and some intresting expearimints was maid on
them by the Committy and the Counsel on Crismus day. Lickwise on
Poltry Fouls with regard to there being of Utility for the Tabel
and “under the latter head” the report informs “sum results hav
bean obtained witch air considdered very satisfactry,” but their
will be more degested trials of the subjex as the Report says “the
expeariments must be repetid in order to istablish the accuracy
of the deduckshuns.” Wat is remarkable the hens pressented by Mr.
Crockford hav not provd grate layers tho provided with a Better
Yard and plenty of Turf. We hav indevourd to bread the grate Cok
of the Wud onely we have no Wud for him to be Cok of&mdash;and now
for aquotic Warter Burds we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span> hav wite Swons but they hav not any
cygnitures, and the Black is very unrisenable as to expens but Mr.
Hunt has offerd to black one very lo on condishun hits not aloud
to go into the Warter. The Polish swons wod hav bread onely they
did not lay. The Satiety contanes a grate number of Gease and witch
thriv all most as well as they wood on a commun farm and the Sam
with Dux. We wonted to have dukelings from the Mandereen Dux but
they shook there Heds. Too ears a go a qantitty of flownders and
also a quantitty of heals of witch an exact acount is recordid
wear turned into one of the Ponds but there State as not bean
looked into since they wear plaiced their out of unwillingnes to
disturb the Hotter. At pressent their exists in one Pond a stock
of Karps and in too others a number of gould fish of the commun
Sort. The number left as bean correcly tacken and the ammount
checkt by the Pellycanes and Herrins and Spun-bills and guls and
other piskiverous Burds. Looking at the hole of the Farm in one
Pint of Vue we hav ben most suckcesful with Rabits and Poltry and
Piggins and Ginny Pigs but the breading of sich being well none to
Skullboys, I beg as to their methodistical principals to refer your
Honner to Master Gorge wen he cums home for the Holedays. I furgot
to say the Parnassian Sheap was acomidated with a Pen to it self
but produst nothin worth riting. But the attemps we hav maid this
here, will be prosycutid next here with new Vigors.</p>

<p>Honnerd Sur,&mdash;their is an aggitating Skeam of witch I humbly aprove
verry hiley. The plan is owen to sum of the Femail Fellers,&mdash;and
that is to make the Farm a Farm Ornay. For instances the Buffloo
and Fallo dears and cetra to have their horns Gilded and the
Mufflons and Sheaps is to hav pink ribbings round there nex. The
munkys is to ware fancy dressis and the Ostreaches is to have their
plums stuck in their heds, and the Pecox tales will be always
spred out on fraim wurks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> like the hispaliers. All the Bares is to
be tort to Dance to Wippert’s Quadrils and the Lions mains is to
be subjective to pappers, and the curling-tongues. The gould and
silver Fesants is to be Pollisht evry day with Plait Powder and the
Cammile and Drumdearis and other defourmd anymills is to be paddid
to hide their Crukidnes. Mr. Howerd is to file down the tusks of
the wild Bores and Peckaris and the Spoons of the Spoonbills is
to be made as like the Kings Patten as posible. The elifunt will
be himbelisht with a Sugger candid Castle maid by Gunter and the
Flaminggoes will be toucht up with Frentch ruge and the Damisels
will hav chaplits of heartifitial Flours. The Sloath is proposd to
hav an ellegunt Stait Bed&mdash;and the Bever is to ware one of Perren’s
lite Warter Proof Hats&mdash;and the Balld Vulters baldnes will be hided
by a small Whig from Trewfits. The Crains will be put into trousirs
and the Hippotomus tite laced for a waste. Experience will dictait

<p>T<span class="smaller">HE</span> very earliest of one’s literary recollections must be the
acquisition of the alphabet; and in the knowledge of the first
rudiments I was placed on a par with the Learned Pig, by two maiden
ladies that were called Hogsflesh. The circumstance would be scarcely
worth mentioning, but that being a day boarder, and taking my dinner
with the family, I became aware of a Baconian brother, who was never
mentioned except by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> Initial, and was probably the prototype of
the sensitive “Mr. H.” in Lamb’s unfortunate farce. The school in
question was situated in Token-house Yard, a convenient distance for a
native of the Poultry, or Birchin-lane, I forget which, and in truth
am not particularly anxious to be more certainly acquainted with my
parish. It was a metropolitan one, however, which is recorded without
the slightest repugnance: firstly, for that, practically, I had no
choice in the matter; and secondly, because, theoretically, I would
as lief have been a native of London as of Stoke Pogis or little
Pedlington. If such local prejudices be of any worth, the balance
ought to be in favour of the capital. The Dragon of Bow Church, or
Gresham’s Grasshopper, is as good a terrestrial sign to be born under
as the dunghill cock on a village steeple. Next to being a citizen
of the world, it must be the best thing to be born a citizen of the
world’s greatest city. To a lover of his kind, it should be a welcome
dispensation that cast his nativity amidst the greatest congregation of
the species; but a literary man should exult rather than otherwise that
he first saw the light&mdash;or perhaps the fog&mdash;in the same metropolis as
Milton, Gray, De Foe, Pope, Byron, Lamb, and other town-born authors,
whose fame has nevertheless triumphed over the Bills of Mortality. In
such a goodly company I cheerfully take up my livery; and especially as
Cockneyism, properly so called, appears to be confined to no particular
locality or station in life. Sir Walter Scott has given a splendid
instance of it in an Orcadian, who prayed to the Lord to bless his own
tiny ait, “not forgetting the neighbouring island of Great Britain:”
and the most recent example of the style I have met with, was in the
Memoirs of Sir William Knighton, being an account of sea perils and
sufferings during a passage across the Irish Channel by “the First
Gentleman in Europe.”</p>

<p>Having alluded to my first steps on the ladder of learning, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span> may
not be amiss in this place to correct an assertion of my biographer
in the Book of Gems, who states, that my education was finished at a
certain suburban academy. In this ignorant world, where we proverbially
live and learn, we may indeed leave off school, but our education only
terminates with life itself. But even in a more limited sense, instead
of my education being finished, my own impression is, that it never
so much as progressed towards so desirable a consummation at any such
establishment, although much invaluable time was spent at some of those
institutions where young gentlemen are literally boarded, lodged, and
<i>done for</i>. My very first essay was at one of those places, improperly
called <i>semi</i>-naries, because they do not half teach anything; the
principals being probably aware that the little boys are as often
consigned to them to be “out of a mother’s way,” as for anything else.
Accordingly, my memory presents but a very dim image of a pedagogical
powdered head, amidst a more vivid group of females of a composite
charter-part dry-nurse, part housemaid, and part governess,&mdash;with a
matronly figure in the back ground, very like Mrs. S., allegorically
representing, as Milton says, “our universal mother.” But there is
no glimpse of Minerva. Of those pleasant associations with early
school days, of which so much has been said and sung, there is little
amongst my retrospections, excepting, perhaps, some sports which, like
charity, might have been enjoyed at home, without the drawback of
sundry strokes, neither apoplectic nor paralytic, periodical physic,
and other unwelcome extras. I am not sure whether an invincible
repugnance to early rising may not be attributable to our precocious
wintry summonses, from a warm bed into a dim damp school-room, to play
at filling our heads on an empty stomach; and perhaps I owe my decided
sedentary habits to the disgust at our monotonous walks, or rather
processions, or maybe to the sufferings of those longer excursions
of big and little, where a pair of compasses had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span> pace as far and
as fast as a pair of tongs. Nevertheless, I yet recall, with wonder,
the occasional visits of grown-up ex-scholars to their old school,
all in a flutter of gratitude and sensibility at recognising the spot
where they had been caned, and horsed, and flogged, and fagged, and
brimstone-and-treacled, and blackdosed and stickjawed, and kibed, and
fined,&mdash;where they had caught the measles and the mumps, and been
overtasked, and undertaught&mdash;and then, by way of climax, sentimentally
offering a presentation snuff-box to their revered preceptor, with an
inscription, ten to one, in dog Latin on the lid!</p>

<p>For my own part, were I to revisit such a haunt of my youth, it
would give me the greatest pleasure, out of mere regard to the
rising generation, to find Prospect House turned into a Floor Cloth
Manufactory, and the playground converted to a bleachfield. The
tabatière is out of the question. In the way of learning, I carried off
nothing in exchange for my knife and fork, and spoon, but a prize for
Latin without knowing the Latin for prize, and a belief which I had
afterwards to unbelieve again, that a block of marble could be cut in
two with a razor.</p>

<p>To be classical, as Ducrow would say, the Athenians, the day before
the Festival of Theseus, their Founder, gratefully sacrificed a ram,
in memory of Corridas the schoolmaster, who had been his instructor:
but in the present day, were such offerings in fashion, how frequently
would the appropriate animal be a donkey, and especially too big a
donkey to get over the Pons Asinorum!</p>

<p>From the preparatory school, I was transplanted in due time to what is
called by courtesy, a finishing one, where I was immediately set to
begin everything again at the beginning. As this was but a backward way
of coming forward, there seemed little chance of my ever becoming what
Mrs. Malaprop calls “a progeny of learning;” indeed my education was
pursued very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span> much after the plan laid down by that feminine authority.
I had nothing to do with Hebrew, or Algebra, or Simony, or Fluxions, or
Paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches; but I obtained a supercilious
knowledge of accounts, with enough of geometry to make me acquainted
with the contagious countries. Moreover, I became fluent enough in
some unknown tongue to protect me from the French Mark; and I was
sufficiently at home (during the vacations) in the quibbles of English
grammar, to bore all my parents, relations, friends, and acquaintance,
by a pedantical mending of their “cakeology.” Such was the sum total
of my acquirements; being, probably, quite as much as I should have
learned at a Charity School, with the exception of the parochial
accomplishment of hallooing and singing of anthems.</p>

<p>I have entered into these personal details, though pertaining rather
to illiterate than to literary reminiscences, partly because the
important subject of Education has become of prominent interest, and
partly to hint that a writer may often mean in earnest what he says
in jest. One of my readers at least has given me credit for a serious
purpose. A schoolmaster called, during the vacation, on the father of
one of his pupils, and in answer to his announcement of the re-opening
of his establishment, was informed that the young gentleman was not to
return to the academy. The worthy parent declared that he had read the
“Carnaby Correspondence” in the Comic Annual, and had made up his mind.
“But, my dear Sir,” expostulated the pedagogue, “you cannot be serious;
why the Comic Annual is nothing but a book full of jokes!” “Yes, yes,”
returned the father, “but it has let me into a few of your tricks. I
believe Mr. Hood. James is not coming again!”</p>

<p>And now, it may be reasonably asked, where I did learn anything if not
at these establishments, which promise Universal Knowledge&mdash;extras
included&mdash;and yet unaccountably produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span> so very few Admirable
Crichtons?<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It may plausibly be objected, that I did not duly avail
myself of such overflowing opportunities to dabble, dip, duck in, and
drink deeply of the Pierian spring, that I was an Idler, Lounger,
Tatler, Rambler, Spectator, anything rather than a student. To which
my reply must be, first, that the severest punishment ever inflicted
on my shoulders was for a scholar-like offence, the being “fond of my
book,” only it happened to be Robinson Crusoe; and secondly, that I did
go ahead at another guess sort of academy, a reference to which will
be little flattering to those Houses which claim Socrates, Aristotle,
Alfred, and other <i>Learnedissimi Worthii</i>, as their Sponsors and
Patron Saints. The school that really schooled me being comparatively
of a very humble order&mdash;without sign&mdash;without prospectus&mdash;without
ushers&mdash;without ample and commodious premises&mdash;in short, without
pretension, and consequently, almost without custom.</p>

<p>The autumn of the year 1811, along with a most portentous comet, “with
fear of change perplexing monarchs,” brought, alas! a melancholy
revolution in my own position and prospects, by the untimely death of
my father; and my elder brother shortly following him to the grave, my
bereaved mother naturally drew the fragments of the family more closely
around her, so that thenceforward her dearest care was to keep her
“only son, myself, at home.” She did not, however, neglect my future
interest, or persuade herself by any maternal vanity that a boy of
twelve years old could have precociously finished his education; and
accordingly the next spring found me at what might have been literally
called a High School, in reference to its distance from the ground.</p>

<p>In a house, formerly a suburban seat of the unfortunate Earl of
Essex&mdash;over a grocer’s shop&mdash;up two pair of stairs, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> a very
select day-school, kept by a decayed Dominie, as he would have been
called in his native land. In his better days, when my brother was his
pupil, he had been master of one of those wholesale concerns in which
so many ignorant men have made fortunes, by favour of high terms, low
ushers, gullible parents, and victimised little boys. As our worthy
Dominie, on the contrary, had failed to realise even a competence,
it may be inferred, logically, that he had done better by his pupils
than by himself; and my own experience certainly went to prove that
he attended to the interests of his scholars, however he might have
neglected his own. Indeed, he less resembled, even in externals, the
modern worldly trading Schoolmaster, than the good, honest, earnest,
olden Pedagogue&mdash;a pedant, perchance, but a learned one, with whom
teaching was “a labour of love,” who had a proper sense of the dignity
and importance of his calling, and was content to find a main portion
of his reward in the honourable proficiency of his disciples. Small as
was our College, its Principal maintained his state, and walked gowned
and covered. His cap was of faded velvet, of black, or blue, or purple,
or sad green, or as it seemed, of all together, with a <i>nuance</i> of
brown. His robe, of crimson damask, lined with the national tartan. A
quaint, carved, highbacked, elbowed article, looking like an <i>émigré</i>,
from a set that had been at home in an aristocratical drawing-room,
under the <i>ancien régime</i>, was his Professional Chair, which with his
desk was appropriately elevated on a dais, some inches above the common
floor. From this moral and material eminence, he cast a vigilant yet
kindly eye over some dozen of youngsters; for adversity, sharpened by
habits of authority, had not soured him, or mingled a single tinge
of bile with the peculiar red-streak complexion, so common to the
healthier natives of the North. On one solitary occasion, within my
memory, was he seriously yet characteristically discomposed, and that
was by his own daughter, whom he accused of “forgetting all regard for
common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span> decorum;” because, forgetting that he was a Dominie as well
as a Parent, she had heedlessly addressed him in public as “Father,”
instead of “Papa.” The mere provoking contrariety of a dunce never
stirred his spleen, but rather spurred his endeavour, in spite of the
axiom, to make Nihil fit for anything. He loved teaching for teaching’s
sake; his kill-horse happened to be his hobby: and doubtless, if he had
met with a penniless boy on the road to learning, he would have given
him a lift, like the charitable Waggoner to Dick Whittington&mdash;for love.
I recall, therefore, with pleasure, the cheerful alacrity with which I
used to step up to recite my lesson, constantly forewarned&mdash;for every
true schoolmaster has his stock joke&mdash;not to “stand in my own light.”
It was impossible not to take an interest in learning what he seemed
so interested in teaching; and in a few months my education progressed
infinitely farther than it had done in as many years under the listless
superintendence of B. A., and L. L. D. and Assistants. I picked up
<i>some</i> Latin, was a tolerable English Grammarian, and so good a French
scholar, that I earned a few guineas&mdash;my first literary fee&mdash;by
revising a new edition of “Paul et Virginie” for the press. Moreover,
as an accountant, I could work a <i>summum bonum</i>&mdash;i.e. a good sum.</p>

<p>In the mean time,&mdash;so generally unfortunate is the courtship of that
bashful undertoned wooer, Modest Merit, to that loud, brazen masculine,
worldly heiress, Success&mdash;the school did not prosper. The number
of scholars diminished rather that increased. At least no new boys
came&mdash;but one fine morning, about nine o’clock, a great “she gal,”
of fifteen or sixteen, but so remarkably well grown that she might
have been “any of our mothers,” made her unexpected appearance with
bag and books. The sensation that she excited is not to be described!
The apparition of a Governess, with a Proclamation of a Gynecocracy
could not have been more astounding! Of course SHE instantly formed a
class; and had any form SHE might prefer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> herself:&mdash;the most of us
being just old enough to resent what was considered as an affront on
the corduroy sex, and just young enough to be beneath any gallantry
to the silken one. The truth was, sub rosa, that there was a plan
for translating us, and turning the unsuccessful Boys’ School into a
Ladies’ Academy; to be conducted by the Dominie’s eldest daughter&mdash;but
it had been thought prudent to be well on with the new set before being
off with the old. A brief period only had elapsed, when, lo! a leash of
female school <i>Fellows</i>&mdash;three sisters, like the Degrees of Comparison
personified, Big, Bigger, and Biggest&mdash;made their unwelcome appearance,
and threatened to push us from our stools. They were greeted,
accordingly, with all the annoyances that juvenile malice could
suggest. It is amusing, yet humiliating, to remember the nuisances
the sex endured at the hands of those who were thereafter to honour
the shadow of its shoe-tie&mdash;to groan, moan, sigh, and sicken for its
smiles&mdash;to become poetical, prosaical, nonsensical, lack-a-daisical,
and perhaps even melodramatical for its sake. Numberless were the
desk-quakes, the ink-spouts, the book-bolts, the pea-showers, and
other unregistered phenomena, which likened the studies of those four
unlucky maidens to the “Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties,”&mdash;so
that it glads me to reflect, that I was in a very small minority
against the persecution; having already begun to read poetry, and
even to write something which was egregiously mistaken for something
of the same nature. The final result of the struggle in the academic
nest&mdash;whether the hen-cuckoos succeeded in ousting the cock-sparrows,
or vice versa&mdash;is beyond my record; seeing that I was just then removed
from the scene of contest, to be introduced into that Universal School
where, as in the preparatory ones, we have very unequal shares in the
flogging, the fagging, the task-work, and the pocket-money; but the
same breaking-up to expect, and the same eternity of happy holidays to
hope for in the Grand Recess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>In brief, a friend of the family having taken a fancy to me, proposed
to initiate me in those profitable mercantile mysteries which enabled
Sir Thomas Gresham to gild his grasshopper; and like another Frank
Osbaldestone, I found myself planted on a counting-house stool, which
nevertheless served occasionally for a Pegasus, on three legs, every
foot, of course, being a dactyl or a spondee. In commercial matters,
the only lesson imprinted on my memory is the rule that when a ship’s
crew from Archangel, come to receive their L. S. D., you must lock up
your P. Y. C.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
